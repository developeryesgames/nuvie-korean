Ye Lost Art of Ballooning

    Back in the days of the Avatar's Quest, rumors spread of a strange sight in the skies. A tinker from the town of Minoc, claimed to have rediscovered the lost art of ballooning. According to ancient lore, this was a mystical practice that allowed one to soar through the air, higher than the birds themselves. No records have been found of the rituals used to perform this feat, but several farmers from the area still tell tales of strange sights. A strange sphere was seen, way up in the sky, and the voices of men could be heard drifting down from it. The apparition drifted up into the clouds and was lost to sight. This took place years ago, and naught has been heard of the mystic art of ballooning since that time.

A Treatise on the Lore of Gargoyles by Norlick the Elder

    Though gargoyles are considered by most to be mere legend, no records exist documenting the origins of the gargoyle "statues" that adorn many castles. Even the towering stone guardians of the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom have many of the physical characteristics of the "legendary" gargoyle. Nobody seems to know where they came from either. Despite the lack of hard evidence, there have been a fair number of unconfirmed reports of sightings of live gargoyles.It is the opinion of this author that daemons are a form of gargoyle. As many reliable encounters with daemons have been documented in various scholarly works, perhaps this is the best source of further information on the subject of gargoyles.

=== BOOK 60 ===
Tangled Tales

    Once upon a time, in a strange land far away, there was a wizard's apprentice. His master, Eldritch, sent him on three quests, knowing he would learn his lessons best with the real world as his classroom. He encountered many strange and wonderful things. Ghouls and griffins stood in his way, and ghosts and giants as well. But he also found new friends, and brave adventurers to help him. He rode on a flying carpet, and on the back of a giant turtle. Finally, after exploring an abandoned mine, a pyramid, and a castle in the clouds, he finished his third quest. He had learned so much on his journeys that his master rewarded him well, and declared him a wizard in his own right. He soon opened a school of his own, and as the years passed, and students came and went, his beard grew long with years.

=== BOOK 61 ===
Knights of Legend, Volume I

    Once, in the kingdom of Ashtalarea, there was a great war. For a time it seemed the forces of evil would triumph, but through the valiant efforts of Seggallion, the greatest knight in the land, the forces of the dark lord Pildar were finally driven back and defeated. All was well for a time, but years later Pildar had grown powerful again. From his dark tower he wove his evil schemes, and managed to capture the Duke, and the great knight Seggallion as well. With his greatest foe out of the way, he was prepared once more to set out on a campaign of conquest. In those troubled times, a party of great heroes arose. After many perilous adventures they finally won their way to Seggallion's prison and set him free. They then set forth to discover what had become of the Duke...

=== BOOK 62 ===
The First Age of Darkness

    Early in the reign of Lord British there came unto the land of Britannia a powerful wizard named Mondain. He brang forth many creatures of great evil, using the power of his magic to control them. And there was great suffering throughout the land. It was in these days that the Avatar first came unto our realm, to vanquish Mondain and liberate our people.

=== BOOK 63 ===
The Second Age of Darkness

    After Mondain's passing, Minax the enchantress brought forth terrors to menace the populace. She had been apprentice to Mondain. Perhaps more than that, if the moaning and wailing that echoed through the halls outside their shared bedchamber bore any meaning. She established a reign of death and destruction, her magic fueled by the strength of her passion. Again it was only the return of the Avatar that put an end to the oppression. Minax was vanquished, as Mondain before her.

=== BOOK 64 ===
The Third Age of Darkness

    Once Minax was gone, peace reigned for twenty years. And then the last of Mondain's legacy became known. For he and Minax had together produced an unholy creation known only as Exodus. For many years it had stayed hidden, patiently gathering information to heighten its powers. Finally it chose to exploit the results of its diligence. Creating a mighty castle to reside in, Exodus brought forth a third plague of monsters, and nowhere in Britannia was safe from its relentless evil. This was the greatest challenge yet for our hero from another world; yet once again the Avatar proved triumphant. And with the defeat of Exodus, a new era of prosperity began.

=== BOOK 65 ===
The Quest of the Avatar

    In days not long past, the Council of Wizards erected shrines to the eight virtues, that people throughout the land might meditate upon them. It was through studying the eight virtues and the three underlying principles that the great hero, who had defeated the Triad of Evil, started down the path that led to Avatarhood.

 For verily it is known that the three principles are Truth, Love and Courage;
 And that from Truth arises Honesty;
 And from Love arises Compassion;
 And from Courage arises Valour;
 And that Truth comingled with Love gives rise to Justice;
 And Love comingled with Courage gives rise to Sacrifice;
 And Courage comingled with Truth gives rise to Honor;
 And Truth, Love and Courage all united create Spirituality;
 And the absence of all three principles leads to the vice of pride, which leads us to think of the virtue that is its opposite, that of Humility.

    And on the quest to become the embodiment of the eight virtues, the Avatar recovered the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom, and discovered that the one underlying concept that leads to the three principles which lead to the eight virtues is Infinity. Ponder this well, oh seeker!

=== BOOK 66 ===
Warriors of Destiny

    After the shining example set by the Avatar, Britannia seemed all set to enter a golden age of peace and plenty. And then a great tragedy took place. Lord British, the beloved ruler who united the land of Britannia, and saw it through some of the hardest times in its history, was lost. He had gone on an expedition to explore the newly discovered underworld, and never returned. Many thought him dead. Lord Blackthorn took control in his absence, declaring martial law to maintain order. It was also around this time that the three shadowlords appeared at Stonegate. They were powerful, evil creatures, who could warp the minds of men and turn them away from the three principles. 'Tis said they could draw on "the power of the vortex" to transport themselves instantly anywhere in the realm. It was a dark time. The Avatar was summoned back to Britannia, and ultimately managed to rescue Lord British before the collapse of the Underworld, restoring him to his rightful place on the throne.

=== BOOK 67 ===
Windwalker

    In exotic Khantun, there was a benevolent Emperor known as Chao Ti. He ruled wisely and well until his Warlord, Zhurong, acquired an elixir from the evil alchemist Shen Jang to put the Emperor into a coma. Evil spirits from the Astral Plane took over shrines throughout the land, and it was a dark time. But a young student, after completing his studies of the martial arts in a small monastery, managed to liberate the shrines, defeat the warlord, and cure the Emperor with the Elixir of Immortality. Long will his name be honored in Khantun.

=== BOOK 68 ===
The Caverns of Freitag

    A great dragon named Freitag came unto the Mystic Isles, and there was much fear and anguish amongst the populace.

Of Dreams and Visions

    Some say that in our dreams our astral selves journey to other realms of existence. Others say that imps and daemons create dreams to disturb our sleep. Now let the truth be known! Dreams are messages from the spirit world. Someday we will learn to decipher them, and benefit greatly thereby.

Plant Lore

 Mistletoe is easiest to find in the spring. Cut the sprigs with your left hand for greatest effectiveness. Hibiscus leaves can be used to make a tea which is excellent for sore throats. Never step on a dandelion, for it will anger any leprechaun who sees you do so.

She also met a strange caterpillar, and a cat that could vanish, with its grin dissappearing last. The queen of hearts yelled "Off with her head!" and her guards ran up to grab Alice - but then she awakened, and realized it had all been a dream.

Heed well as I, Naxatilor, write of how I brought the Codex to our land and  thereby ushered in the time of prosperity:*
 With the help of the Lensmaker I crafted the Vortex Lens, by which I could  see the Codex where it originally rested.*
 I created the Vortex Cube to focus the power of the Moonstones and draw  the Vortex down to the world.*
 Then I used the lens to form an image of the Codex upon the cube.*
 The Vortex touched our plane, the image became solid, and the Codex was  brought down to be used properly by our race!&

Deep below the land there is another land. In that land live many strange creatures.*
 The most interesting of these creatures look something like our wingless ones. These daemons, however, are pale and soft.*
 Some say that these daemons from the underworld can speak. And, to be sure, they make sounds that are similar to our language.*
 But as everyone knows, no creature without wings is truly intelligent. Fables of talking daemons must be discredited.&

 The Codex was placed within the Temple of Singularity, there to be viewed by those requiring its knowledge.*
 The seers of the land, led by Naxatilor, protected the Codex with a forcefield.*
 Only those upon sacred quests for wisdom are allowed to reach and read the Codex.*
 Within the Codex is written the one right and true answer to any problem. One has but to reach the Codex, read it, and interpret its advice properly.*
 With perfect wisdom and infallible knowledge, all that remains is to have the control, passion and diligence required to follow the proper course.*
 These are the underpinnings of our society, and so our race is able to use the Codex wisely and well.*

When a child hatches from his egg, he is born without wings. But even from birth one can tell whether a child will grow up to be a winged or a wingless one.*
 The wingless ones cannot speak, and lack the intelligence of the winged ones. They must be guided.*
 The winged ones are few, but they are entrusted with the intelligence and wisdom of the race. They must guide.*
 Both winged and wingless ones spring from the same eggs, and both belong to the same family.*

(Translation)

All begins with the three principles: Control, Passion and Diligence.*
 From Control springs Direction. From Passion springs Feeling. From Diligence springs Persistence.*
 But these three virtues are no more important than the other five:*
 Control combines with Passion to give Balance. Passion combines with Diligence to yield Achievement. And Diligence joins with Control to provide Precision.*
 The absence of Control, Passion and Diligence is Chaos. Thus the absence of the principles points toward the seventh virtue, Order.*
 The three principles unify to form Singularity. This is the eighth virtue, but it is also the first, because within Singularity can be found all the principles, and thus all the virtues.*
 A circle has no end. It continues forever, with all parts equally important in the success of the whole.*
 Our society is the same. It too continues forever, with all members (and all virtues) equal parts of the unified whole.&

Plans for the construction of a hot air balloon.

 First you must have a wicker balloon basket made, large enough to carry several passengers. Then you'll need a big iron cauldron, to hold a fire to generate the hot air. Next you must have a huge bag sewn out of silk, to hold the hot air in. Lastly, get enough rope to tie the balloon securely to the basket. Once you've gathered all of these together, use these plans to assemble them. When flying your balloon, you'll find that a ship's anchor makes the best ballast, and is also useful for stopping the balloon where and when you wish.

As always, the Codex is open to the pages bearing exactly the information you need.

 "To return the Codex to the Vortex, place a convex lens exactly midway between the Codex and the Flame of Singularity, so that the light from the flame converges on the Codex. Place a concave lens between the Codex and the Flame of Infinity, so that its light diverges over the Codex. Then place the eight moonstones within the Vortex Cube. Set it on the ground in front of the Codex, and use it to return the Codex from whence it came."
