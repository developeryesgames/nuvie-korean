2|"Ask Iolo about that."|
2|"He'll throw us a fine feast if you can deal with the @gargoyle invasion somehow."|
2|"I've been with you since the start of this quest, haven't I?"|
2|"It could be worse."\n*\n"Some of them are pretty eager to show their @gratitude, if you know what I mean..."|
2|"It's Dupre - sounds like dew pray, remember?"|
2|"Lord British gave me strict orders not to leave your side until this quest is complete."\n*\n"Besides, you know how I hate to miss a good quest."|
2|"Please, let's not talk about ducks..."|
2|"That's right."\n*\n"Lord British likes to keep grails around to use at his @banquets, but he's always losing them."|
2|"They may be the toughest threat we've ever faced.|
2|"Why, questing, of course! We've been on many a @quest together, you and I."|
2|"Wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more..."|
2|"Yes, $P?"|
2|"Yes, enough chit chat. Let's go find some action!"|
2|"Yes, you've gone on some really fine ones."\n*\n"When you're not around I have to settle for rescuing @damsels, finding @grails, and the like."|
2|a ruggedly handsome man, wearing a gleaming suit of armor.\n*|
3|"A home needs not @walls to make it so."|
3|"A pleasure."|
3|"Ask Dupre about that."|
3|"I feel that Lord @British does not understand their true nature."|
3|"I feel you need my guidance through the wild parts of Britannia. I'd best stay with you."|
3|"I help my @friends when they need it."\n*\n"The rest of my time I prefer to spend exploring the @woods."|
3|"I know him better than you might think."|
3|"I know little of their nature. I believe there are some @mages who have investigated them, however."|
3|"I prefer the Deep @Forest."\n*\n"Spiritwood isn't as dense, and it has those strange @wisps everywhere."|
3|"I'll follow you wherever you might choose to lead - you know that."|
3|"In many ways they are the lifesblood of the realm. Without trees, we could not long endure."|
3|"It is @home to me."\n\n*"I love walking in the dark shadows of the trees, and studying the nature of the forest @creatures."|
3|"Perhaps one of the members of the council could tell you more."|
3|"Shamino Salle' Dacil."|
3|"Those that dwell in the woods have lives of their own, more interesting to me than the ways of townfolk."\n*\n"There is much to be learned from the animals, if you will but listen."|
3|"Though we have spent much time apart between your several visits to our realm, still I consider you one of my closest friends."|
3|"When folk ask why I have no walls in my home, I ask where are the @trees in theirs!" He smiles.|
3|"Yes, my friend?"|
3|Dupre says "Now Shamino's going on about talking to animals... The whole world's going batty!"|
3|a quiet man, who almost seems to be a creature of the forest.\n*|
4|"|
4|"A drink worthy enough to greet an old friend."|
4|"All right, make it Frasier's @Folly, then."|
4|"Ask Shamino about that."|
4|"But maybe I shouldn't tell you about that. After all, I did promise..."|
4|"But we have no gold, $G!"|
4|"His nibs, the king, told me I should stay with you constantly."\n*\n"I'll make an exception when you have to relieve yourself, of course."|
4|"I've been a crossbow maker for so long, I've gotten weary of it."\n\n*"Hopefully, now that my @apprentice has taken over the shop, I'll be able to spend more time as a @bard."|
4|"I've been with you since we saved you from those @gargoyles, haven't I?"|
4|"I've still got to tell you that story about Dupre sometime..."|
4|"If you want me to @gather all our gold together so you can carry it, just say so."\n*\n"Or I could @split it up evenly, if you prefer."|
4|"Iolo's the only name I remember having." (He pronounces his name 'Yo-low.')|
4|"It's one of my favorites."|
4|"My favorite one is about the time I had to wake Dupre up for a tournament...|
4|"My hut is in the Deep Forest, south of Yew."\n*\n"My horse Smith lives there."|
4|"My shop still sells the finest crossbows in the land."\n*\n"I've done a lot over the years to refine the design, and I trained my apprentice well."\n*\n"I'm sure she'll carry on the tradition in fine fashion."|
4|"None of us are carrying any gold, $G."|
4|"Not as big as @Britain, but it's a peaceful town."|
4|"Oh, you should get my wife @Gwenno to teach it to you some time."|
4|"Remember, he doesn't like people to call him that..."|
4|"She's had more time to develop her musical talents than I all these years."\n*\n"But after this @quest I hope to join her in @Minoc and enter the artisan's @guild."|
4|"That's too heavy for you... But I'll let you have it anyway!"\n*|
4|"There always seems to be a quest when you come to visit us, doesn't there?"\n*\n"Some time you should just drop by for @tea."|
4|"They're pretty ugly looking, if you ask me..."|
4|"Though there is still need for the instruments of war, as I grow in years I would now take up those of peace."|
4|"We don't have enough gold to bother with, $G."|
4|"Well, $P, do you need @help with something? Or maybe you've got time for a @story, eh?"|
4|"Yes, it's always been a hobby of mine."\n*\n"Have you heard the piece 'Stones' that I composed some years ago?"|
4|"Yes, you're right. I'm sorry." He whispers to you, "Ask me later when he's not around..."|
4|"You know. Where Mr. @Nose hangs out."|
4|"You're carrying enough already, I think."|

5|"$P! 'Tis good to see thee again. Much hath happened since thou last departed our realm."|
5|"'Tis I who should thank thee, Avatar, for all thou hast done for Britannia."|
5|"'Tis in the west wing of the castle, just south of mine own chambers."|
5|"'Twill serve thee well in thy travels if thou dost learn to master its powers."|
5|"Ah, 'tis thee indeed, $P. Here is the key to my castle."|
5|"Ah, 'tis thee indeed, $P. Take this key."|
5|"It will unlock the gatehouse by the southern entrance to the castle."|
5|"Then you can use the lever inside to raise the portcullis, and the crank will lower the drawbridge."|
5|"The same key will also let you into the sewers under the castle."*|
5|"Ah, thou hast heard of my little friend?"|
5|"All our efforts thus far have availed us naught."|
5|"Ask the leaders of each town to tell thee of that.|
5|"Aye, Tholden is my chancellor."|
5|"Bring the book back later, when thou art less burdened."|
5|"Britannia is under attack by gargoyles such as those thou just fought."|
5|"But I must make sure 'tis truly thee."*\n\n"Only the true Avatar would know what was contained in the Compendium I sent."*|
5|"But conceit of this sort is not proper at all, and Hubert the Lion was due for a fall."|
5|"By now the gargoyles may have captured them all."|
5|"Do thou ask @Tholden."|
5|"Do thou ask him of this mission. Perhaps thou canst prove of some assistance."|
5|"Find thy Compendium, then come speak with me again."|
5|"Good $T, $P. What wouldst thou speak of?"|
5|"He is my @chancellor."|
5|"He is the Captain of the Guard."|
5|"Her name is Sherry, and I'm quite proud of her."|
5|"Hmmmm... I have such a stone, as thou may recall."|
5|"How canst one fend off rotworms?"|
5|"How doth giant squids crush their prey?"|
5|"How doth sea serpents attack?"|
5|"How wert the headlesses produced?"|
5|"Hubert the Lion was haughty and vain, and especially proud of his elegant mane."|
5|"I am Lord British, as thou knowest well."|
5|"I cannot help thee with that."|
5|"I collect rare books."|
5|"I did not know that there were more such orbs."|
5|"I hath promised a great reward to whosoever shalt bring me a copy."|
5|"I have had my servants place some equipment there, in case thou shouldst have need of it."|
5|"I see thou hath misplaced thy key to the castle."\n*\n"Here is another."|
5|"I'm certain she is the only talking mouse in all of Britannia."|
5|"I've known it by heart, ever since I heard it as a child."|
5|"If thou doth wish me to @repeat all this later, thou need but ask."|
5|"In the proper positions,|
5|"It is our belief in them that sets us apart from the cruel invaders who would destroy all that we hold dear."|
5|"It's called 'The Wizard of Oz.' Ever heard of it?"|
5|"Lastly, any time thou dost need @healing, do thou but ask me."|
5|"Long hath I anticipated this moment..."|
5|"May fortune favor thee."|
5|"My favorite story is '@Hubert the Lion.'"|
5|"Nay, 'tis not the correct answer. Consult thy Compendium."|
5|"Not since my childhood have I read this wondrous story."|
5|"Now let me tell thee what hath transpired since thy last visit."|
5|"Of course, thou mayst feel free to borrow anything in my castle, if thou shouldst need it."|
5|"Perhaps thou canst drive these vile creatures back into the bowels of the earth from whence they came."|
5|"Please take good care of my little friend."|
5|"She comes by my room every night, so I can tell her @stories."|
5|"Stay strong in thy commitment to the eight virtues."|
5|"Thanks to thee, I sit once more upon the throne of Britannia."|
5|"The @gargoyles art indeed the greatest threat our realm has ever known."|
5|"The vast underworld from which thou didst rescue me hath collapsed."|
5|"There's one in particular I've been hunting for many years."|
5|"They have been coming up through the dungeons."|
5|"Thou art carrying too much for me to reward thee properly..."|
5|"Thou art correct."|
5|"Thou art welcome to see her, if thou dost wish."|
5|"Thou canst find her wandering throughout the castle."|
5|"Thou hath found a copy!"|
5|"Thou must hurry if thou wouldst foil their evil schemes..."|
5|"Thou wilt discover that the placement is the key."|
5|"Though 'tis a heavy burden in such @troubled times as these."|
5|"Thus far they have mainly been attacking the @shrines of the eight @virtues."|
5|"To open a gate, use the stone, and carefully position it a few feet from thee."|
5|"We are fortunate indeed that fate hath brought thee here in our hour of need."|
5|"Well, I'd rather thou didst not call me that."|
5|"Well, if thou dost run across it in thy travels,|
5|"What art reapers remnants of?"|
5|"What creature art wisps oft mistaken for?"|
5|"What doth trolls lack?"|
5|"What part of the tangle vine doth put one to sleep?"|
5|"What valued item canst one find near the spawning grounds of Hydras?"|
5|"When the Shrine of Compassion didst fall, Sir @Geoffrey sent a party to free it."|
5|"Where hath images of the silver serpent been seen?"|
5|"Whilst thou art here, I have a room in the castle set aside for thy personal use."|
5|"Who told thee of that nickname!?"|
5|"Yet still there are forces of evil abroad in the land."|
5|Gingerly, he takes the tome. "Here is your reward." He gives you some glowing gems.|
5|I would greatly appreciate if thou couldst bring it here."|
5|Lord British waves his hand, and your whole party is healed!|
5|You show Lord British the black stone.|
5|the noble ruler of Britannia.\n*|
5|the stone canst conjure gates to take thee to numerous destinations."|
6|" She has studied many languages, and perhaps she can decipher this book for thee."\n\n"One more thing, Avatar..."|
6|"'Twas I who learned of thy peril through my mystic arts, so that aid might be sent unto thee."|
6|"Best ask Lord British about it."|
6|"Certainly, milord. Perhaps thou canst make better sense of it than I." says Iolo.|
6|"Dost thou have the stone that opened the gate?"|
6|"From whence could it have come? The gargoyles, perhaps?"|
6|"Hail to thee $G, and well met."|
6|"Hast thou gone to the Lycaeum and shown Mariah the book? 'Tis most important."\n*\n"There is naught else I can help thee with at this time."|
6|"I believe he has some knowledge of such items."|
6|"I no longer have the book, milord." replies Iolo.|
6|"I noticed that thou didst arrive through a red gateway."|
6|"Indeed, the only one I have ever seen is that which Lord British himself possesses."|
6|"Iolo, I saw that thou didst find a book."|
6|"It's written in a language I know not."|
6|"Might I examine it?"|
6|"Strange..."|
6|"Such items are quite rare."|
6|"Take it to Mariah at the Lycaeum, the finest scribe on the great Council of Wizards."|
6|"That is too bad. I had hoped thou might take it to Mariah and have her translate it."|
6|"This has a picture on its cover of a gargoyle standing with one foot on the chest of a slain human."|
6|"This is interesting."|
6|a concerned looking mage.|
7|"Alas, they failed dismally."|
7|"Best not waste time talking..."|
7|"Good luck, and my prayers go with thee."|
7|"I must confess I fear the worst."|
7|"I sent a party of ten to recapture the Shrine of Compassion from the gargoyles."|
7|"I'm glad to see thee, $P. Perhaps thou canst prevail where others could not."|
7|"Mayhap they learned something which might aid thee."|
7|"Perhaps the end of the realm is nigh."|
7|"The gargoyles are such powerful foes, and they are spreading so fast..."|
7|"The survivors are recuperating in the town of Cove."|
7|"Thou hadst best speak to Lord British before aught else."|
7|"Thou wouldst do well to speak with them first."|
7|"Who knows what acts of villainy the gargoyles are comitting even as we speak?"*\n\n"I hope you've had a chance to visit Cove and speak with Gertan."|
7|a tall, handsome man.|
8|"'Tis the greatest treasure in all the realm."|
8|"'Twas founded by Lord British."|
8|"A fine ruler indeed. 'Tis a pleasure to keep his kingdom running smoothly for him."|
8|"All the little details of governing, all the paperwork falls on my shoulders."\n*\n"Someone must do it, and yet I miss the days when I was a carefree adventurer."|
8|"I am Tholden von Bazillius, Chancellor to Lord @British."\n*\n"In my younger days, I was known as 'The @Werecat of the Wine Cellar'..."|
8|"I cannot help thee with that."|
8|"I could tell you stories... But there's no time for that now."|
8|"I hope I have been of assistance, $G."|
8|"Records to keep, festivals to plan, I'm so busy... But I can spare you a moment, $G."|
8|"The rune and mantra of Compassion are in the keeping of the bards at the @Conservatory."\n*\n"I entrusted them with the rune due to their compassionate nature."\n*\n"As for the other runes - they are no longer together, as they were when the @Codex was recovered."\n*\n"Since then, they have become scattered throughout the land. Each was sent to a town near its shrine."\n*\n"If thou dost ask the lords of each of these towns, they should be able to tell thee more."\n*\n"The towns are Moonglow, Jhelom, Yew, Minoc, Trinsic, Skara Brae, and New Magincia."|
8|Tholden bows deeply.|
8|Tholden goes down on one knee and kisses your hand.|
8|a preoccupied man holding a ledger under one arm.\n*|
9|"All right. Now I can hear my bedtime stories again!"\n*\n"I'll leave my stuff with you in case you need it."|
9|"Boats make me seasick."|
9|"Can I have some?"|
9|"Come visit me again soon!"|
9|"Do you have any cheese?"|
9|"Dust mice are no friends of mine!"|
9|"Eeeek!"|
9|"Give me some @cheese and ask me again."|
9|"Great!"|
9|"He knows the one about @Hubert the Lion by Heart!"|
9|"He reads me bedtime @stories every night."|
9|"He used to read me bedtime @stories every night."|
9|"I am Lord @British's friend, @Sherry."|
9|"I can help you! Do you want me to come with you?"|
9|"I can slip through openings that are too small for you to fit through!"|
9|"I don't smell any cheese!"|
9|"I wish people would clean up under their beds and cabinets..."|
9|"I'm not leaving until we get out of this thing!"|
9|"Kerchew!"|
9|"Methinks you're starting to imagine things..."|
9|"Nitters @fiblik."|
9|"Oh, goodbye. Does this mean you want me to go home now?"|
9|"Oh, that's too bad."|
9|"Ok."|
9|"Okay."|
9|"Pleased to meet you!"|
9|"Squeak @squirk?"|
9|"Squeak, squeak, @squeak!"|
9|"Squeeeeek!"|
9|"Talking to a mouse?" says Dupre.|
9|"Thank you very much!"|
9|"That's my favorite story."|
9|"Travelling with you is fun! I hope we find some more cheese soon."|
9|"Well, you're no fun."|
9|"With that many people I'd get trampled!"|
9|"You're funny!"|
9|The mouse wiggles its whiskers at you.|
9|a cute little mouse.|
10|"'Cause Dick and Harry both called in sick."|
10|"A quest, a chest, oh what a @jest!"|
10|"And @jeer!"|
10|"And @prance! To dance a Corybantic dance!"|
10|"But I will give you this @hint that may lead you to it..."\n*\n"Search the @chest in @Nystul's room."|
10|"Call him Mr. @Nose... But don't tell him I said so!"|
10|"Congratulations! You're exactly right!|
10|"Did you enjoy my jokes?"|
10|"Do you think I will?"|
10|"Good! Maybe you can @teach it to me someday!"|
10|"Have you heard the one about the nun, the dragon, and the drunken penguin?"|
10|"Hee hee, ho ho, to spread good cheer I go! Come talk to me again and I'll give you another show!"|
10|"Ho eyo he hum, I've got a @clue! It's important, and just for you!"|
10|"Ho ho, hee hee, thou art funnier than me! To ask a jester of $Z!"|
10|"How foolish of you to think so!|
10|"I did my best, did I amuse you? If not, I hope I did confuse you."|
10|"I just said @that!"|
10|"I lurch 'round like an @alcoholic!"|
10|"I'll show you fun before I'm @done!"|
10|"If hints were mints and mints were hints, think what a @world it would be!"|
10|"It said 'ankh ankh!'"|
10|"It's because they both have the letter 'r'\nin them!"|
10|"Jeer and prance! Prance and @frolic!"|
10|"Let's try it again."\n*|
10|"No, no, no, that's not how it works! You're supposed to say you don't, so I can tell you!"|
10|"Oh, he's no @fun."|
10|"Oh, that's right, I did!"|
10|"Perhaps I don't want to tell you!"|
10|"Perhaps I'll tell you anyway!"|
10|"Really? I'll just have to try harder, then!"|
10|"Riddle me this: Do you know what the goose said to the avatar?"|
10|"Shhh! Don't let him know I told you!"|
10|"That's too bad... Neither have I!"|
10|"To @jape, to jeer, to prance, to frolic! To keep this place unmelancholic!"\n*\n"I practice @tomfoolery for Lord @British - or anyone else who passes too close."|
10|"To teach, to preach, what waste of @speech!"|
10|"Well, who asked you, anyway?"|
10|"What did you think of that one?"|
10|"Why is Dupre like a horseshoe?"|
10|"Why, I'm Chuckles the @jester, of course! You've @heard of me haven't you? Sure you have!"|
10|"Yes, it's crucial to your @quest. Do you want to know what it is?"|
10|"You did? Then I'll tell you another one!"|
10|"You just said '@that!'"|
10|"You've heard a word? Why that's @absurd!"|
10|I won't tell you the clue..."|
10|a carefree fellow in a ludicrous costume.\n*|
11|"@Ariana has the rune, and they could hardly have found a sweeter child to give it to."|
11|"@Kenneth's my name - don't wear it out."|
11|"Bards must be well versed in such matters."|
11|"Dost thou know what it means?"|
11|"Her name is Nan. Whatever you do, don't say anything to her about @spiders..."|
11|"Hmmmm... No, I don't think that's it."|
11|"I asked you not to wear it out! It's the only name I've got."|
11|"I like the confused look on your face too much to ruin it by telling you."|
11|"I've been trying to work the Mantra of Compassion into a song - but I don't know what '@mu' means."|
11|"My @wife and I teach young bards the arts of composition, performance, and improvisation."\n*\n"We also give @concerts on occasion."|
11|"Nobody I know does either."|
11|"Once in a great while a student comes along with such a gift for learning that one need but offer a little guidance and step back to watch them learn."\n*\n"To have such students is the most rewarding part of a teacher's job, and Ariana is one such."|
11|"She has quite an @imagination. Sometimes she lets it carry her away."|
11|"Tell me, what does it mean?"|
11|"Until we meet again."|
11|"Usually it doesn't give her any trouble."|
11|"Welcome, $G! I am Sir Kenneth, and I'd gladly play a @song for thee."|
11|"Yes, I know of the @Rune and @Mantra of Compassion."|
11|Kenneth plays a delightful little melody for you.|
11|a lively bard with laughter in his eyes.\n*|
12|"'Twas given to our most promising student, young @Ariana."|
12|"Every time I pick up my lute, @spiders crawl out of it."\n*\n"There must be hundreds of them nesting in there!"|
12|"Fare thee well, and watch thy step! The spiders are lurking everywhere."|
12|"I am Lady Nan."|
12|"I cannot help thee with that."|
12|"I hate spiders! They're creepy, ugly, disgusting things! Why won't they leave me alone?"|
12|"I would play for thee, but I'm worried about my lute."|
12|"Iolo gave them to me for my birthday."|
12|"Oh, yes. Perhaps if I wore those I could play..."|
12|"She's very talented. She'll go far, if the spiders don't get her..."|
12|"The Mantra of Compassion is 'mu.' Is that a spider on your shoulder?"\n*\n"No, 'tis just a trick of the light."|
12|"Why, making @music, of course."|
12|"With my @lute."|
12|"Yes, I know of the @Rune and @Mantra of Compassion."|
12|Iolo says to her, "Now, now, my dear. Have you forgotten about the @gloves I gave you?"|
12|a nervous young bard.\n*|
13|"Are you on an important quest?"|
13|"He's my teacher."|
13|"Hi! Did you get permission from my parents to borrow the rune?"|
13|"I already gave it to you, silly. I hope you can figure out how to use it."|
13|"I can't remember it now... And @Kenneth just taught it to me last week..."\n*\n"Wait, I know! It's 'mo!'"\n*\n"Or maybe it was 'om'... Or 'mu,' or 'um'... It was something like that."|
13|"I have the Rune of Compassion. Isn't it pretty?" She reaches into her pocket and takes it out to show you.*\n\n"Do you need it for something?"|
13|"I want to be a bard when I grow up. They have more @fun than anybody!"|
13|"I'd best hold onto it then. I was told to look after it carefully."|
13|"I'm learning to be a @bard. I like to @play the harpsichord best."|
13|"I'm not supposed to let anyone else have it. But if you truly need it..."\n*\n"I don't know what I should do."\n*\n"I know! My parents run the Blue Boar Tavern. Go ask them if you can borrow the rune."\n*\n"If they say 'tis okay, I'll give it to you."|
13|"I've been studying to be a bard since I was this many." She holds up three fingers.\n*\n"I'd like to play something for you, but I'm not good enough yet."\n*\nShe looks away for a moment, then turns back to you, blushing slightly.\n*\n"Will you come back to hear my music when I am older, if you can?"|
13|"My parents told me never to talk to strangers. What's your name?"|
13|"Oh yes, lots of it!"|
13|"Oh, hello again."|
13|"Oh, you're carrying too much right now. You'd better come back for it later."|
13|"Ok. Now I can talk to you!"|
13|"Ok."|
13|"See you later."|
13|"Then here you are." She hands you the rune. "I wish you the best of luck on your quest."|
13|"They taught me all about compassion. They say it's very important for bards."|
13|"Well, if you get their permission later, let me know."|
13|"What do you mean?"|

30|"Britannia has been so prosperous lately that there's been a lot of demand for gold coinage."\n*\n"Of course we have you to thank for bringing us the Codex and saving Lord British."\n*|
30|"By royal decree, I am the only one allowed to @mint the official coinage of the realm."\n*"Copper @pence, silver pieces, and @gold crowns - they're all made right here."\n*\n"My @father ran the mint before me. But I get lonely here sometimes..."\n*\n"It's so nice of you to come by and talk to me."\n*\n"@Kytyn will never believe it when I tell her I got to meet the @Avatar in person!"|
30|"Do you have any gold nuggets you'd like to trade in for crowns?"|
30|"Hello. My name's Terri - I run the mint."\n*\n"Say, aren't you the Avatar? Yes, I recognize you from your portrait..."\n*\n"My mother used to tell me stories about you when I was a girl."\n*\n"You probably wouldn't remember her, but she was at the big celebration right after you recovered the Codex."\n*\n"Anyway... I just wanted to tell you that I always|
30|"Here, let me show you." She takes out a sample of each coin for you to look at.\n*\nThe pence has an ankh on one side, and crossed swords on the other.\n*\nThe silver piece has Lord British's face on the front, and a serpent on the back.\n*\nAnd the gold crown is a familiar sight, with a crown and the symbol of the Codex.\n*\nAll three of them look newly minted - they're very shiny.|
30|"I get most of my gold from people who bring in nuggets to @exchange them for coins."\n*|
30|"I know you're very busy, saving Britannia and all that, but I hope you'll come and visit me again...\n*|
30|"I'm eating right now. Come see me at the mint sometime and we can chat."|
30|"It really was delightful talking to you."|
30|"It's Terri...|
30|"May he rest in peace."|
30|"May she rest in peace."|
30|"My @mother told me all about it."|
30|"Normally there's a ten percent tax on the exchange."\n*\n"But since you're the Avatar, I'll give you a full hundred crowns for every stone's-weight of gold you have."\n*\nShe exchanges all of your gold nuggets for newly minted crowns.|
30|"Of course, I'm sure you only carry @gold crowns with you, being as important as you are."\n*\nShe reaches over and squeezes your shoulder affectionately.|
30|"Oh, you've come back to visit me again!"|
30|"She's a good friend of mine. She runs the @museum."|
30|"Well, if you do later, you know where to find me."|
30|"You must be mistaken. But let me know if you come across any gold nuggets later."|
30|"You must be the bravest|
30|"You should visit there sometime. But please stay and talk to me a bit longer first..."|
30|But I wish I had been named after you."|
30|Don't you think that would be a good name for an Avatar's wife?"|
30|She winks at you.|
30|You notice she was staring at you with a dreamy look in her eyes.\n*\n"Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. I was just|

31|"He also established the @conservatory that shares the building with the museum."\n*\n"The @roads that span the realm are his doing as well."|
31|"Hello and welcome, $G!"|
31|"I can tell you more about any of the @exhibits you're interested in."|
31|"I can't help you with that. Try the @library at the Lycaeum."|
31|"I can't tell you much about that. Lord British donated it to the museum, but I can't get him to talk about it."\n*\n"From what little he's said, I think it's an artifact from his home world."|
31|"I used to be a @falconer."|
31|"I'm the curator of the royal @museum of @oddities."|
31|"If you want to ask Gertan, I think he's in Cove."|
31|"It's just one of the @projects Lord British has funded to provide a better life for his people."|
31|"It's very pretty."|
31|"My name is Kytyn." She smiles. "Perhaps that explains why I like @birds."|
31|"Somebody found a huge boulder with a jet of water spraying out of it."\n\n*"We had it magically teleported here, buried with its surface flush with the ground, and then we built this building on top of it."\n*\n"Of course we left a hole in the floor for the water to spray through."\n*\n"I often drink from it when I'm thirsty. The water is quite good, but there's something strange about it."\n*\n"It vanishes somehow before it hits the ground..."|
31|"Someone named '@Gertan' donated all those parts."\n*\n"I think he said something about a dragon named 'Freitag'."|
31|"Sometimes I can hear their @music drifting through the walls..."\n*\n"Usually that noisy, crackling field drowns it out, though."|
31|"That was before Lord @British appointed me to my current position."|
31|"That's a very curious device. The motion of each gear turns another, until eventually the movement is propagated back to the same gear again."\n*\n"There's one thing I can't figure out."\n*\n"We've made plans of the device, and I can't see how they started it moving in the first place."\n*\n"None of the gears would turn unless all the others were already going."\n*\n"What's worse, the motions serve to hold the machine together."\n*\n"If the gears were still, the whole thing would fall apart! How it was built is quite a mystery."|
31|"That's for sure."|
31|"The field is generated by a curious spell."\n*\n"By some process not yet understood, it converts magical energy into electrical energy, producing a continuous discharge."\n*\n"If we understood this process better, it would probably lead to all sorts of useful applications."|
31|"There is a great deal of knowledge available there for the serious scholar."|
31|"This skeleton seems to be about ten times older than any other ever found in Britannia."\n*\n"Surely it has much to tell us about our origins, if we only knew what it meant!"|
31|"We have the @monolith, the @energy field, the perpetual motion @machine, the @bones of Zog, the mystery @fountain, and the @dragon's head, wings, and egg."*\n\n"Which one were you curious about?"|
31|She favors you with a deep, throaty purr that sounds just like a cat.|

32|"A fancier home than any of my family ever lived in. Yet I still miss my simple hut in the forest."|
32|"Aye, I used to live in the @forest and hunt wild boars."\n*\n"But one day I presented a @roast boar as a gift to his @majesty, and he liked it so much he hired me as his @cook."|
32|"Excuse me a moment." He pulls a napkin from his belt and mops at his brow. "Now, what were you saying?"|
32|"Funny you should mention that... It reminds me of my secret recipe for @roast boar."|
32|"He's a good man. Likes plenty of @pepper in his stew."|
32|"Hey, my old buddy $P! Good to see you again."|
32|"I @cook for all those who live in the @castle, and for any @guests who dine with Lord British as well."\n*\n"'Tis sastisfying work, yet at times I wish I could @travel with one such as you..."|
32|"I like having a job where I can make people happy."|
32|"I shouldn't even speak of such things."\n*\n"After all, you are the Avatar, and I but a lowly cook. Please forgive me."|
32|"I'll never tell.|
32|"I've heard about all of your adventures. I wish I were a warrior too, and not just a cook!"|
32|"Lord British has many friends."|
32|"Maldric, I am. Once Maldric the @boar hunter, now Maldric the cook."|
32|"Oh, $G Avatar, 'tis an unexpected pleasure to see you again!"|
32|"See you later. And next time you dine with his majesty, I'll cook you something special."|
32|"Spice puts some variety in life, is what I always say."|
32|"The secret is in the spices. It's an old family @recipe."|
32|"There's fire enough in my kitchen, but 'tis no place for romance."|
32|"Those were good times. But I'm happy here."|
32|"Wait a minute," he interrupts, "I recognize you... You're the Avatar! I've always wanted to meet you."\n*\n"|
32|"Yes indeed."|
32|"Yes, Lord @British himself."|
32|"You're a pretty spicy little number yourself!"|
32|*\n\nHe seems about to say more, with a hopeful look in his eyes.\n*\nBut then he turns away without speaking.|
32|*\n"I wish it were still there, so I could invite you to come spend an evening by the @fireplace with me...|
32|From the day I first saw your portrait, I knew you must be the most beautiful woman in all Britannia."|
32|Though for one so sweet, I must say I'm tempted.|

33|"'Tis the finest library in all Britannia."\n*\n"I study many different things, but I find learning old languages the most interesting."\n*\n"One can learn so much about how our own language developed!"|

33|"I must have both halves of the tablet before I can tell you any more."\n*\n"This piece I have had for quite some time, and I've learned all I can from it."|
33|"I'd be glad to look at it for thee." She examines the book.\n*\n"Oh! I've seen this script before!"\n*\n"I have part of an ancient silver tablet in my study with writing both in our language and this."\n*\n"I have learned only a little from studying it, but I can make out a few words."\n*\n"The title is 'The Book of Prophecies,' and it says something about 'the end of our world.'"\n*\n"If only I had the other half of the @tablet, perhaps I'd be able to decipher the rest of the book."|
33|"I'd suggest you find a Compendium to study, then come talk to me again."|
33|"I'm sorry to put you to the trouble, but I'm only supposed to help those who know the ways of magic."\n*\n"So I have to ask you a question to test you..."\n*|
33|"I'm the newest member of the @Council of Wizards. Somebody has to keep things running smoothly."\n*\n"In my spare time I use the @library to pursue my own studies."|
33|"No, that's not it. Haven't you a Compendium of knowledge to draw on?"*|
33|"Nystul sent word to me that thou hast a book written in a strange tongue."\n*\n"I'd not mind looking at it for thee..."\n*\n"But I'd find the task much easier if thou wouldst bring it here!"|

35|"I once heard of a @master glassblower who could make glass swords..."|
35|"I plan to publish a paper about how the world is flat, to dispel all this foolish talk to the contrary."|
35|"If I could keep this to analyze while you go get me a glass sword, I'll try and make a copy for you."|
35|"It will contain high tides, low tides, ebb tides, flood tides, @spring tides, and @neap tides."|
35|"It would be very tricky to duplicate, being magical in nature, but I believe I might be able to do it."|
35|"Just kidding... Here it is. Now I'll melt down the glass sword and try to cast a lens for you."|
35|"Lenses and the like."|
35|"Lord British has requested the publication of an almanac for use by the general populace."|

41|"But one lens is not enough! A blue lens is needed as well."|
41|"Even virtue has its price."|
41|"For five gold coins I can use my powers to divine the mantra for you. Shall I do this?"|

41|"I cannot see it. More gold is needed."\n\nHow much do you give her?|
41|"I require a small donation for my services."\n\nHow much do you give her?|
41|"I see a great Vortex."|
41|"I see you have yet to fulfill your destiny."|
41|"It is a small price for so profound a word."|
41|"Much conflict lies before you. Your end..."|
41|"Quickly - more coins before I lose the thread of this vision!"\n\nHow much do you give her?|
41|"She's doubtless fallen asleep, and you've wasted good money for nothing..."|
41|"So be it."|
41|"Some more gold would shed further light on your destiny..."\n\nHow much do you give her?|
41|"Strange creatures will you face..."|
41|"The future looks dark. All is unclear."|
41|"There is a violet lens that is crucial to your quest. It is broken, and must be made whole."|
41|"Though all is dark, I see a light at the end of the tunnel."|
41|"Wait... There is some barrier before me."|
41|"What are we waiting for!" whispers Dupre.|
41|"Yes he was a terribly @honest fellow."|
41|"Yes, I can foretell your @future for you."|
41|"Yes, daffodils."|
41|"Yes, now all is made clear to me!"|
41|"You and your companions will face terrible choices..."|
41|"You must have two lenses, else all is for naught."|
41|"You must seek the answer to that elsewhere."|
41|"You shall travel throughout the land before you are through."|
41|"You will journey into the depths of the earth..."|
41|"You will need powerful magic to prevail..."|
41|"Your ambitions outreach your means."|
41|"Your destiny awaits."|
41|After a time, she speaks.|
41|Finally Penumbra opens her eyes again. "The word you seek is 'ahm.'"|
41|She closes her eyes in concentration. For long minutes you wait.|
41|She holds her hands out on either side of her crystal ball, not quite touching it, and closes her eyes.|
41|She opens her eyes. "I can see no more for now. Leave me, that I might rest."|

42|"Have you had your fortune told yet?"|
42|"Here's to Mandrake!"|
42|"I'll drink to that!"|
42|"I'll drink to that," he says, suiting action to words.|
42|"In all the towns of Britannia, you'll find no better brew."|
42|"Leaving already? And you're not even wobbling yet..."|
42|"My drinking buddy! Let's drink a toast to him, wherever he is."|
42|"Oh, yes, of course. Come, have a seat."|
42|"She's a strange one, but she has the gift."|
42|"Some people think @Penumbra's a hoax. But she knows her stuff. You should bear with her - she can truly be of great assistance to you."|

45|"Shamino and I travelled the Spiritwood together for a time."|
45|"Stone indeed!"|
45|"That's drivel, friend Starhelm!" says Van Kellian.|
45|"The gargoyle went to live in the @Dry Land."|
45|"There's one that they call @Sin 'Vraal."|
45|"They turn to stone when ye slay them."|
45|"Van murmurs "Ugliness is but skin deep, just as beauty is."|
45|"Wisps are nasty flickers, very hard to kill. Not like @gargoyles, now."|
45|"Yes, Sin 'Vraal is an evil wretch."|
45|He was just about to punch someone when you approached him.*\n\n"This is no time for talk. There's fighting to do!"|
45|an angry-looking man wearing short swords on either hip.|
46|"'Tis such a topsy-turvy world|
46|"A pleasure, to be sure, $Z."|
46|"A very good $T to ye, my friend."|
46|"Aha! That means monsters are not deserving of mercy!" says Stelnar|
46|"And then ye forget valour, and soon ye are overrun by monsters!"|
46|"Call me Van."|
46|"Courage grows. Why not love?"|
46|"Did ye know that the mantra of pride is 'mul?' A @beggar told me that."|
46|"Good $T, and farewell."|
46|"He believes he does us a favor. This I must hear."|
46|"Hmm. No, I cannot help ye with that."|
46|"How do you do. I am the bard Van Kellian."|
46|"I gave him a few coins, of course."|
46|"If Lord British suffers him to live, then I will not harm him."|
46|"If ye let one gargoyle live,|
46|"Just as compassion comes from a love of all mankind."|
46|"Please, speak your name, $G."|
46|"Shall I sing for ye?"|
46|"Songs to soothe the soul and refresh the mind."|
46|"Starhelm and I have often debated the nature of the gargoyle @Sin 'Vraal."|
46|"Their cries are fierce yowlings to make the blood run cold with fear."|
46|"There is little enough dignity in the life of a beggar."|
46|"Tho' she disdains to speak to me|
46|"Though, mind ye, I myself have never faced one in combat."|
46|"Valour comes from the courage to be virtuous."|
46|"Well, I hear their skin is stony and rough."|
46|"Well, perhaps another time, then."|
46|"Well? How about a @song?"|
46|"What possible threat could one @gargoyle living alone in the Dry Lands be?"|
46|"Why, singing is my trade."|
46|Ah how I pine and sigh for her|
46|He glances behind him and ducks, as if expecting someone to throw something at him.\n*\n"Bit of a brawl going on just now. Be glad to talk to you some other time."|
46|His voice is rich and mellow.|
46|I would that I could catch her eye|
46|I would that I were handsome- o|
46|Iolo rolls his eyes and whispers to you.|
46|Sing ho eyo he hum!"|
46|Stelnar says "I'll tell ye, Van."|
46|The bard plays a harp and sings.|
46|When my sweet lady-love whirls by|
46|a man dressed in velvets and silks of yellow, green and blue.|
46|and then even cyclopses."|
46|then ye'll be tempted to spare trolls,|
47|"'Twas a bitter fight; I almost died o' the wound."|
47|"'Twas certainly the wrong place for an old seadog to be!"|
47|"But afore I could apply sparks to the tinder, a huge swarm o' rats drove me away."|
47|"Good journey."|
47|"Hawkins threw me hand to the sharks."|
47|"He be long gone now, he an' his ship the Empire. A pox on his memory!"|
47|"Hmm."|
47|"I be Heftimus McPry, matey."|
47|"I can't help ye, matey."|
47|"I fought Captain @Hawkins, that scurvy dog, an' he struck off me @hand with his sword."|
47|"I needed it to start a fire in a @dungeon."|
47|"I sleep in front of it every night."|
47|"I thank ye kindly, matey. The last I saw o' that bit o' parchment..."|
47|"I was the greatest sabre fighter on all the high seas."|
47|"I'll be allright, matey."|
47|"I've been into the dungeon @Wrong."|
47|"Once Buccaneer's @Den quaked at the mention o' me name."|
47|"Pah!" He spits on the ground.|
47|"So be it, matey."|
47|"Soon as I've saved up a stake, I'm going in there to dig for gold."|
47|"Sorry, don't really know that."|
47|"Spare a doubloon fer an old seahand?" He holds out his hand.|
47|"Thank, ye kindly, matey."|
47|"That be an island, matey, and no place fer a decent soul like yerself."|
47|"That bit o' news will cost ye twenty coins. What say ye, matey? Aye or nay?"|
47|"The scrap o' map lies in the dungeon @Wrong, matey."|
47|"Then maybe ten? Aye or nay?"|
47|"Then one day..."|
47|"There's a @cave on this island that looks a lot safer."|
47|Do you give him any money?|
47|He laughs, chokes, and coughs for a while.|
47|How much do you give?|
47|You do not have that much.|
47|a beggar, clad in the rags of a sailor, with a hook for a right hand.|
48|"A mouse could get the rune, of that I'm sure!"|
48|"Around sunset things get really rowdy here!"|
48|"Bye-bye, $G. It was nice talking to you."|
48|"Culham has oft sung of it, with @Jerris and @Starhelm."|
48|"Do ye know of the talking mouse? Lord British's friend?"|
48|"Hallo, $G. Welcome to the 'Sword and @Keg.'|
48|"He is brave when @fighting, but he is afraid to sing by himself."|
48|"He would be much nicer if he were not so angry all the time."|
48|"His real name is Stelnar."|
48|"I cannot help ye with that."|
48|"I had an @idea, but nobody listened to me."|
48|"I know 'tis a boy's name, but I like it all the same."|
48|"I know how to get it from the you-know-@what."|
48|"I take orders for drinks, $G."|
48|"It's Lyssandra, but ye can call me @Andy."|
48|"Look carefully at where floor and wall meet."|
48|"See yon hole in the north wall?"|
48|"Shhh!" She glances about to see if you have been overheard.|
48|"Some day I'll be a @fighter, ye know."|
48|"Sometimes 'tis rough here but I doesn't mind."|
48|"That's where it took the rune!"|
48|"The @rat," she whispers conspiratorially to you.|
48|"The fighting here usually begins over--"|
48|"They tried all manner of tricks to get it out but they all failed."|
48|"Well, ye would think it was a dumb idea anyways..."|
48|Her voice drops to a whisper, "--the @rat!"|
48|It is a wonder how she can duck the hurled debris and avoid the flying fists.|
48|She is agile, and balances trays of mugs deftly on each hand.|
48|She is quick, and never spills a drop of ale.|
48|a girl of perhaps twelve years.|
49|"'For but a few coins,' say the gypsies,' we will lead it away and bury it far from here.'"|
49|"'Tis a true story, my friend."|
49|"'Yonder nag hath contracted 'Arturosis.'"|
49|"...Sing 'ra,' my friends, sing 'ra'!"|
49|"...in Old @Magincia." He laughs.|
49|"A great feast is held 'mongst gypsykind."|
49|"Ah, yes. That's quite a story, too."|
49|"Along come the gypsies. 'Aiee!' they cry."|
49|"And then my mantra came to mind|
49|"Arturosis"|
49|"Culham's me name, $G."|
49|"He eats the stuff, swells up and takes ill."|
49|"I call this story..."|
49|"I'll sing, though I'd rather @play."|
49|"I'm not a great singer, but I love to play a song of valour."|
49|"Immanuelle decides to sacrifice the diseased one and the gypsies agree heartily."|
49|"Immanuelle is too happy to hand them the doomed animal's bridle, plus ten coins."|
49|"It makes me @sing."|
49|"It seemed like such an easy climb|
49|"It's fighting time. Talking's for later."|
49|"May we meet again soon, friend."|
49|"Meanwhile, Immanuelle thanks virtue that the equine epidemic was caught early on!"|
49|"Naughty Nomaan dropped the Rune of Valor, and the rat carried it off."|
49|"Now there's a @tale."|
49|"Oh. Perhaps a @song, then."|
49|"Oho, that be a name in need of a story."|
49|"Once I heard a haunting melody..."|
49|"One goes out and gathers a poisonous weed from the swamps."|
49|"Sing 'ra,' my friends, sing 'ra.'|
49|"So the gypsies make a great kettle of horse stew and bury the rest."|
49|"Sorry, I cannot help ye with that."|
49|"The Mantra of Valour bringeth great cheer."|
49|"The other sneaks into town and puts the plant into the trough of a horse."|
49|"The owner, Immanuelle, doesn't know what to do."|
49|"Two gypsies come to Trinsic, hungry as usual."|
49|"Unless it be immediately removed, the rest shall catch the same fatal disease.'"|
49|"Well met, $G $Z. Let me tell ye a @tale."|
49|"Well, it used to be a ghost town."|
49|"Well, not everyone likes gypsy tales, I suppose."|
49|"Well, poor horse doesn't know better."|
49|"When @spirits be low, I play tunes to bring @cheer."|
49|"Why, hullo there, $G. And who might ye be?"|
49|"Why, hullo there, $P. Have I told ye the one about the gypsies?"|
49|"Would ye really like to hear a story?"|
49|#|
49|'Tho boulders bounced and passed with speed.|
49|'Tis a song to make thee strong|
49|And the ground be far..."|
49|As sliding snow swept loose my feet."|
49|Culham sings for you.|
49|He laughs and plays a little tune on his lute.|
49|He laughs loudly.|
49|I crawled upon the Serpent's Spine|
49|I hadn't even time to blanch|
49|My frozen fingers gripped to rock|
49|Once again a brawl breaks out!|
49|The pub is filled with the sound of singing.|
49|Too loudly. Stelnar and Jerris begin to argue over whether it was a rat or a mouse.|
49|When down there came an avalanche!"|
49|When the mountains be high|
49|a small man in a handsome vest made of seashells.|
50|"Care to join me in a drink?"|
50|"Comes from Verity Isle," he says.|
50|"Darndest thing, too."|
50|"Don't you know it's rude to interrupt a man when he's brawling?"|
50|"Goodbye."|
50|"Hello there, $G."|
50|"It was a rat, as sure as the world is flat."|
50|"It's in the refrain of the @song."|
50|"It's mostly made of honey. Ask a brewer."|
50|"It's right there. On the north wall. See it?"|
50|"Jerris is my name. And yourself?"|
50|"Look carefully, $G. Ye will see it if ye keep on looking."|
50|"Lord Zellivan himself hoisted it up while a guard pulled me clear."|
50|"Nomaan dropped the rune and the rat took it into a little @hole."|
50|"Not a mead drinker, I guess." He shrugs.|
50|"Obviously a rat hole."|
50|"Pleased to make your acquaintance."|
50|"Some day I hope to join @Zellivan's Stalwarts and be a guard."|
50|"Sorry, $G.  I can't help ye with that."|
50|"Well, I'd rather not sing alone. Get Culham to play it."|
50|"When that last earthquake struck, I was pinned 'neath a great tree branch."|
50|He hands you a mug for a swallow.|
50|It is warmed @mead, sweet and bubbly, with a cinnamon stick in it.|
50|Shamino points to a spot west of the bar where the wall meets the ground. "There it is."|
50|a slender man with boots that come up to his thighs.|
51|"'Fraid I can't talk now. I have to cook|
51|"All right." $N gives $Y the $1.|
51|"Anything else I can do for you?"|
51|"Come back when it's ready and have some!"|
51|"Come back when you have some gold."|
51|"Enjoy the drink, matey."|
51|"I be Arvin, mate."|
51|"I can't help you with that."|

59|"'Tis most strange, Avatar, that thou knowest not the Mantra of Justice."|
59|"A letter of permission?"|
59|"A thief stole the rune from the grave of our most respected resident, the former Lord Mayor."|
59|"Begone, Avatar, and return when thou hast more serious business on thy mind!"|
59|"Better to leave it lost."|
59|"Don't be taken in by his @lies."|
59|"Dost thou truly need to speak with that reprehensible thief?"|
59|"Even though the @thief was caught, we have not yet found the rune."|
59|"Go ask Ben the logger."\n*\n"Head west from here into the forest until you can go no further."\n*\n"Then look for a way through the trees to the north."|
59|"He has no family--he's just a drifter!"|
59|"Hmmm...well, no matter," she says suspiciously.|
59|"Hmpf! Well, mayhap 'twould be best for you to seek such wisdom elsewhere!"|
59|"How can that be?"|
59|"How may we assist thee in thy quest?"|
59|"I am Lenora, Lady Mayor of Yew."|
59|"I certainly hope thou wilt be more respectful this time."|
59|"I suppose 'twould be improper to deny anything the Avatar requires."|
59|"In Yew we take pride in our system of @justice."|
59|"Indeed, the @Rune of Justice itself was sent here for safekeeping."|
59|"It is my honor to preside over this town and its @courts."\n*\n"We also provide the finest @wood in the realm."|
59|"May you find that which thou deservest on thy quest."|
59|"Nicodemus the enchanter lives near here. His house lies between two rivers."|
59|"Noble Avatar, the affairs of state weigh heavily upon my time. Pray be precise in thy questioning."|
59|"Noble Avatar, we hardly have time to chat about $Z in view of the perils facing our land!"|
59|"Tell him he's not fooling anyone."|
59|"The Mantra of Justice is 'beh.'"|
59|"The thief is in the jail, awaiting the carriage of justice."|
59|"Then why dost thou waste my time with frivolous requests?!"|
59|"Thou may return when thou seest fit to answer my question!"|
59|"To do so would betray everything the rune itself stands for!"|
59|"Very well then." Putting quill to parchment, she drafts a quick letter.*\n\n"The jailer will now let you in, or verily shall he answer to me!"|
59|"Welcome again, worthy Avatar, to my hall."|
59|"Welcome, worthy Avatar, to the Hall of Justice."|
59|"Well, Avatar. I graciously grant thee another interview."|
59|"What, free the thief in return for the rune? Never!"|
59|"What? What stories has that thief been telling you?"|
59|a tall, stern woman, with graying red hair and a perpetual scowl.|
60|"$G! Am I glad to see thee!"|
60|"'Strewth, it's the Avatar!"|
60|"All right, I admit it. I 'aven't got any kids."|
60|"All right, I give up."|
60|"All right, I'll take your word for it."|
60|"And I'll keep my end of the bargain."|
60|"And spit on Her Ladyship for me!"|
60|"Beg your pardon, $G?"|
60|"But it were only because 'is Lordship wouldn't be needin' that stuff no more."|
60|"But that stupid cow they got runnin' this place won't listen to reason--a little give-and-take, know what I mean?"|
60|"Even a thief like me wouldn't lie to the Avatar."|
60|"Go to the Slaughtered Lamb; I 'id the rune under a potted plant there."|
60|"I 'ad me @kids to feed, didn't I?"|
60|"I 'id the rune under a potted plant in the Slaughtered Lamb inn."|
60|"I admit I robbed that grave."|
60|"I ain't talkin' to you, you're just like all the rest!"|
60|"I don't want these pompous blighters to 'ave it. Okay?"|
60|"I only stole to feed them, and that's the @truth."|
60|"I tell you what."|
60|"I'll never crack, no matter 'ow many times you come back!"|
60|"I'll tell you where the rune is if you'll let me @go. I've got me kids to think of."|
60|"I'm but a poor farmer, forced into crime by the harshness of these times."|
60|"If I tell you where the rune is, will you take it away?"|
60|"Maybe it was necessary, $P, but lying makes me uneasy. Even to someone like him."|
60|"Me name's Boskin, $G."|
60|"My poor children've got no one to take care of them now."|
60|"Now go away and leave me alone."|
60|"Please, $G! Tell them to let me @go 'ome!"|
60|"The rune is 'idden under a potted plant at the Slaughtered Lamb."|
60|"Then the gargoyles can take the lot of you!"|
60|"There weren't no other way to feed me family, $G!"|
60|"True? Of course it's true!"|
60|"Who's there?" the thief calls insolently.|
60|"You mean it, $G? Are they gonna let me go 'ome?"|
60|"You'll never get nothin' out of me!"|
60|"You're me last light in a world of darkness."|
60|"You've got to get me @out of 'ere, $G!"|
60|As you leave, Iolo whispers to you.|
60|His face falls. "Then I ain't sayin' nothin'. I've got me kids to think of, I do."|
60|His face lights up. "I knew I could count on you, $G!"|
60|Tears fill the man's eyes.|
60|Tell them about me poor fatherless @kids! They'll listen to you!"|
60|The thief's tone becomes more respectful as he recognizes you.|
60|a short, heavyset man dressed in rags.|
61|"'Taint my place to talk about that. You should go see Her Ladyship, the Mayor."|
61|"But not without Her Ladyship's @permission."|
61|"Don't know nothing about that."|
61|"Feller broke into the @grave of His Lordship, the late Mayor."|
61|"Give it back when you're done."|
61|"Good $T, $G. Done with the key yet?"|
61|"Good $T, $G. What can I do for you?"|
61|"Got a @prisoner in @solitary right now."|
61|"Got four of the cleanest @cells you could ask fer."|
61|"Gotta have a letter if you want to see the thief."|
61|"He's in @solitary, right over there."|
61|"I mind the @jail."|
61|"Much obliged," the taciturn jailer says as he takes the key.|
61|"Name's Pridgarm."|
61|"Need it here."|
61|"Nope. Sorry, not interested."|
61|"Okay, here's the key."|
61|"Okay. Never had nobody sound so interested in jest hearing about the jail before."|
61|"Pity. Never been offered a bribe before."|
61|"Say, you looking to get the keys to my jail cells?"|
61|"Well, bring it back to me when you are."|
61|"Well, gotta have a letter if you want to see the thief."|
61|"Well, that does me no good."|
61|"Well, where is it?"|
61|"Well, ya know, I shouldn't do this."*\n\n"But Her Ladyship is a little too strict about who she puts in here."*\n\n"So I make up fer it by being a little careless with the keys, if you take my meaning."*\n\nHe tosses you some keys, then turns his back on you.|
61|"You got a letter of permission from Her Ladyship?"|
61|"You offering me a bribe?"|
61|"You'll need my @key to get in there."|
61|"Yup, I could give you the key...."|
61|He thinks for a moment.|
61|The jailer nods and says "$T."|
61|The old man simply shrugs and keeps on whittling.|
61|Without another word, the jailer returns to his carving.|
61|an old man, tall and thin. He spends all his time whittling.|
62|"$P! 'Tis a great joy and relief to see thou hast returned to Britannia, $G!"|
62|"Alas, I know nothing of $Z, $G."|
62|"Am I not already a member of thy band?"|
62|"Ask me to @join and I will, gladly, $G!"|
62|"Beg pardon?"|
62|"But I know that the gargoyles are fierce fighters, and a great threat to the land!"|
62|"Farewell! Return when thou hast more news of thy quest!"|
62|"Gladly, $G!"|
62|"Good $T, $G! Hast thou fared well in thy travels?"|
62|"Good $T, $G. Hast thou need of my services again?"|
62|"I can barely think out here a'sea!"|
62|"I cannot leave thy party since I am not in it!"|
62|"I fear I know little that would help in this situation, $G."|
62|"I know little of the gargoyles, $G, save what rumors I hear."|
62|"I would gladly @join thee, $G, if thou had a use for my skills."|
62|"I've heard that Nicodemus the enchanter lives between two rivers."|
62|"Joyous news! Thou must tell me of it sometime."|
62|"Let us discuss such matters ashore."|
62|"May the virtues guide us in our quest!"|
62|"Mayhap I can help thee in thy struggle against the @gargoyles."|
62|"Mayhap I could help. Ask me to @join thy band, $G, and gladly I will!"|
62|"Mayhap if one of them left your band, thou might have more need of me."|
62|"Nay, $G, thou seemst to have enough companions as it is."|
62|"Perhaps I misunderstand, $G."|
62|"Since thy last visit to Britannia, I have lived in Yew, blessing crops and tending to sick animals."|
62|"Surely I misunderstand thee, $G."|
62|"Surely my help in thy previous quests was not so insignificant that thou hast forgotten it!"|
62|"Thou needst but ask and I will gladly @join, $G."|
62|"Though I know 'tis unbecoming of a simple druid to do so, I miss the excitement of our quests together!"|
62|"Very well. Thou needst but ask..."|
62|"Whatever thou thinkest best, $G."\n*\n"Thou mayst keep my supplies."|
62|"Why, my name's Jaana, $G."|
62|Everyone seems pleased to be reunited, albeit under tense circumstances.|
62|For the first time, you notice that Jaana seems definitely seasick!|
62|She greets your other traveling companions.|
62|the druidess Jaana.|
63|"'Tis indeed an honor."|
63|"'Tis my privilege to be mayor of Minoc, the city of @sacrifice."|
63|"Ah, $G $P, the famous Avatar!"|
63|"Ah, thou wouldst be interested to hear of that."|
63|"Ah, well..."|
63|"Alas, he died of the @flu two years ago."|
63|"Aye, a pity, that."|
63|"Aye, this is a big city."|
63|"Farewell, and please honor us with your presence again soon."|
63|"Go ask at her house, on the north side of town."|
63|"Good $T, Avatar. I'm glad thy travels have brought thee here again."|
63|"He's a fine @musician. He lives just across the road from me, in the @guild hall."|
63|"I am Lady Isabella. Thy name, of course, is well @known throughout the land."|
63|"I cannot help thee with that."|
63|"I gave it to @Selganor, the @artisan's guildmaster."|
63|"I have heard much of thy exploits, but never expected to meet you in person."|
63|"I recognized thee from the portrait @Woodroffe made the last time thou came to our land."|
63|"I've heard rumors of such creatures, but I know no one who has actually seen one."|
63|"If I weren't so @busy, I'd take lessons from him myself."|
63|"It must have been wonderful, to drift amongst the very clouds..."|
63|"One of the finest artisans that ever dwelt in Minoc."|
63|"Selganor should be able to tell you more about it."|
63|"Some tales are but empty words, with less substance than the breath that carries them."|
63|"Tara is a very compassionate woman."|
63|"Tell me, is it true you once rode in a balloon whilst on the quest of the Avatar?"|
63|"The artisan's guild is located here."|
63|"The balloonist flew off on an important @mission, and never returned."|
63|"The good healer @Tara should be able to tell you the mantra."|
63|"The tales of thy exploits are known by even the smallest of children."|
63|"We are renowned for our fine @craftsmen."|
63|"We were entrusted with the @Rune of Sacrifice."|
63|"When the Rune of Sacrifice was sent to our city, I entrusted it to their care."|
63|"Yes, ask Selganor."|
63|a woman of elegant demeanor, wearing a finely embroidered dress.|
64|"Ah yes, now I remember. He flew to @Sutek's castle."|
64|"Ah, I knew you'd be somewhere close by."|
64|"But I don't see any!"|
64|"But you have the look of one with more important @business."|
64|"Excellent!" He strums a chord on his lute, then taps you lightly once on each shoulder with it.|
64|"First, you need to make a set of @panpipes. @Julia can teach you how to that."|
64|"Hail and welcome, $P!"|
64|"Have you made a set of panpipes?"|
64|"Hello. There's something I need to ask you, what was it..."|
64|"Hmmmm... I wish I knew the answer to that question..."\n*\nHe turns away from you absent-mindedly.|
64|"I already loaned you the rune."|
64|"I am the @guildmaster of artisans."|
64|"I don't think I can help you there."|
64|"I know she's around here somewhere..."|
64|"I know you'll find some solution to this gargoyle problem."|
64|"I prefer stringed instruments. They make such lovely sounds."|
64|"I'd be glad to loan you the rune, but only members of the @guild are allowed to handle it."|
64|"I'm right here, Selganor!"|
64|"I'm sure you'll be needing this in your travels."|
64|"If you want to join the guild, you need to do two things."|
64|"Indeed."|
64|"It means 'seeker of the @crystal'. Perhaps I'll tell you more some other time."|
64|"It was nice talking to you."|
64|"It's east of Serpent's Hold."|
64|"My name is Selganor. 'Tis a name with a long @history..."|
64|"No, I'm afraid that's not it. Gwenno can help you learn the notes."|
64|"No, that doesn't sound right. If only I had a Compendium to look it up in..."|
64|"Now tell me the sequence of notes in 'Stones' and I'll induct you into the guild."|
64|"Numeric notation will be fine."|
64|"Oh, are you looking for the man who invented the balloon?" He stares upward, stroking his chin pensively.|
64|"Oh, hello. Maybe you can help me with something."\n*\n"My nephew is studying alchemy, and he needs to know this."\n*|
64|"Oh, yes, now I remember!"|
64|"Oh. Well, @Julia can show you how if you need help."|
64|"Perhaps you're interested in joining the @guild."|
64|"Said something about a big job he had to do there."|
64|"She lives just across the road, next door to Lady @Isabella."|
64|"She made my @lute - and most of our other instruments as well."|
64|"She's the mayor."|
64|"Sutek lives on an @island, far to the south."|
64|"Thanks! Now what can I do for you?"|
64|"That's quite a @tale."|
64|"Wait a minute... You're already a member of the guild!"|
64|"What are black pearls used for?"|
64|"What kind of fork should mandrake roots be prepared with?"|
64|"What part of the nightshade mushroom is used in spellcasting?"|
64|"Where does sulfurous ash come from?"|
64|"Yes, ask her about it."|
64|"You also need to commit '@Stones' to memory. 'Tis a simple tune - ask @Gwenno to play it for thee."|
64|"You are now a full member of the guild of artisans."|
64|"You should play your panpipes often - 'twill lighten your step on the long road ahead."|
64|He inspects the pipes. "Very good, very good indeed."|
64|He reaches into a belt-pouch, takes out the Rune of Sacrifice, and hands it to you.|
64|a slender, graceful man tuning a lute.|
65|"'Cah,' that is the word of sacrifice."|
65|"But all of you are well!"|
65|"But gladly can I say that none of your party is dead!"|
65|"But thou art well!"|
65|"Doman..."|
65|"Farewell!"|
65|"I beg thy pardon?"|
65|"I don't understand $Z."|
65|"I hope this visit is for pleasure, not business!"|
65|"I hope thou needest not my services!"|
65|"I see that $Y carries another slain friend."|
65|"I see thy injury, $Y."|
65|"I will heal thee without payment."|
65|"I'm sorry. Without an offering I cannot heal thee."|
65|"I'm the healer for this town."|
65|"I've cared for the @unfit here for threescore years!"|
65|"If thou wilt not pay, I cannot heal thee."|
65|"Is there aught else I can do for thee?"|
65|"My name is Tara."|
65|"Oh! I see that $Y carries a fallen comrade!"|
65|"That isn't enough money."|
65|"Then there is naught I can do save grieve with thee."|
65|"Those who need @healing, @curing, or to be @resurrected."|
65|"Thou art #1 gold piece\s short."|
65|"Thou art poor, but thy cause is just."|
65|"Welcome again, noble Avatar."|
65|"Welcome to my place of healing, Avatar."|
65|"What can I do for thee?"|
65|"Wilt thou make an offering of 10 gold?"|
65|"Wilt thou make an offering of 30 gold?"|
65|"Wilt thou make an offering of 400 gold?"|

66|"@Selganor can tell you more about the guild than I could."|
66|"A bit scruffy, but he's the sweetest husband I could ever ask for."|
66|"A number for every @note, and a note for every @number."|
66|"All right. I'll head back home to Minoc. Come let me know if you need me to join you again later."\n*\n"I'll leave all my things here - some of them might come in handy for you."|
66|"Do you want me to come with you?"|

66|"It's a lively place."|
66|"It's me, Gwenno. You have been away from our realm a long time, haven't you..."|
66|"Let's get our feet back on solid ground first, okay?"|
66|"Nice talking with you."|
66|"Not while you're in that thing!"|
66|"Of course, helping you on your quest is more important than that right now."|
66|"Of course, if you need my help, I could leave the guild for a time and @join you."|
66|"Oh, Selganor sent you, did he? I bet you want to learn '@Stones.'"|
66|"Okay! It will be nice to spend some time on the road again."|

67|"An' there it is, $G, a set of panpipes fit for any bard in the land!"|
67|"Are ye daft? Why would I know anything about $Z?"|
67|"Ask me again when you haven't as many companions."|

67|"Aye, gladly! Let's be on our way."|
67|"Aye, so the great Avatar deigns to return, does he?"|
67|"But it must be freshly @cut!"|
67|"Buy a freshly-cut yew log and take it to a sawmill."|
67|"For now, though, I'm followin' ye, and glad to do it!"|
67|"Go to Yew where they grow the best wood in Britannia."|
67|"Have 'em cut it into a board, and bring it back here."|

67|"I'm tired of carrying all this junk anyway!"|

67|"Join ye? Me?"|
67|"Leave! Nay, 'tis my house. You do the leavin'!"|
67|"Leave?! And jump overboard?!"|
67|"May fortune follow ye on thy way!"|
67|"Named Julia I am, $G, and pleased to meet ye."|
67|"Nay, $G, I know nothing about $Z."|
67|"Nay, $G. Ask me when we're ashore."|
67|"No? What are ye, daft? I canna be makin' pipes without wood!"|
67|"Not likely! Find some other sap to do your bidding!"|
67|"Not to be immodest, but I'm respected by all the @Guild!"|
67|"Now the panpipes are a tricky instrument."|
67|"Sent you to me they did? Aye, I can believe that."|
67|"Sure an' I don't think I can be helpin' ya with this!"|
67|"Sure and you're goin' daft, $G."|
67|"Then I'll show ye how panpipes are made!"|
67|"Though now I'm not so sure I want to be led by a crazy person..."|
67|"Well met, Avatar.|

67|Do ye have a fine yew board for me this $T?"|
67|I'm already in your band!"|
67|If I join ye, where are we gonna go?"|
67|Julia sets the wood down on a bench and starts carving.|

68|"I fear my schedule is packed."|
68|"I have all I need, and have no reason to purchase anything more."|
68|"I have no time to create a basket for which I have no @plans."|
68|"I know not where thou might find a silk weaver to craft it!"|
68|"I weave baskets and beehives, just like my @father and his father before him."|
68|"I will sell thee just #5 $1\s."|
68|"I'm Michelle."|
68|"I'm afraid I don't understand."|
68|"If thou hast need of beehives, these woven ones are the best thou'lt find!"*\n\n"And cheap, too, at #1 apiece."|
68|"Is there aught else thou wouldst buy?"|
68|"It took less time than I had thought it might!"|
68|"Lighten thy load, and then I will weave thee this basket."|
68|"My @baskets are sold throughout Britannia!" she adds proudly.|
68|"Oh, I see."|
68|"Perhaps some other time."|
68|"Such a basket would cost 300 gold, in advance. Art thou still interested?"|
68|"Surely I could do the same."|
68|"Then it was true! Father did weave a basket that big!"|
68|"These baskets are sturdy and decorative."*\n\n"Thou'lt find no better in all Britannia for the price, a mere #1 gold."|
68|"Those $1s cost #1 gold apiece."|

68|"Thou couldst not carry such a basket, loaded as thou art."|

68|"Thou hast not enough money for the basket."|
68|"Thou needn't tell me thy name, $P. The Avatar is famous throughout the land!"|
68|"Well, I can see that this will require a huge silk bag."|
68|"Well, hello again, Avatar!"|

70|"I make @glassware, the finest in the land!"|

70|"Interested, $Y?"|

80|"Aye, $Y, thou hast need of a horse."|
80|"Beg pardon, $G?"|
80|"But all of you are already on horses!"|
80|"But there are a few that fail to please me."|
80|"But thou already hast a horse!"|
80|"But thou canst not afford one!"|
80|"Come back again soon!"|
80|"Come to my shop when I'm open!"|
80|"Good!" $N takes $Y's gold, and hands over the reins of a fine horse.|
80|"Hello again, my friend|
80|"Hello, stranger|
80|"How about|
80|"I also sell @horses, if you wish to @buy one."|
80|"I can hardly bear to part with any of these magnificent beasts."|
80|"I raise horses here, in the stables."|
80|"I think you get the idea."|
80|"If you wish to @buy one of them, just say the word."|
80|"My price is #9 gold pieces, no less. Interested?"|
80|"Not here."|
80|"Others call me...something @else."|
80|"Perhaps some other time then."|
80|"Perhaps some time I will @show you..."|
80|"Some call me Immanuelle, $G."|
80|"Which of you?"|
80|#2) $Y|
80|. What can I do for thee|
80|?"|
80|As you leave, she blows you a kiss.|
80|She winks at you.|
80|a sultry, dark-skinned woman dressed in riding-leathers.|
80|one of thy friends|
80|s. What can I do for you|
80|this $T?"|
80|thy friend|
81|"All right, I'll cure ye."|
81|"All right, I'll heal ye."|
81|"Aye, $Y, I can tell that thou art poisoned."|
81|"Aye, I see thy wound, $Y."|
81|"But you can call me @maam, youngster."|
81|"Doman..."|
81|"Don't bother me with that!"|
81|"Eh? Speak up!"|
81|"Eh? What foolishness is this?"|
81|"Go see a gravedigger. I'll reckon his price'll be lower."|
81|"Hmph! And not so much as a @thank-you."|
81|"I can @heal, @cure, and even @raise dead!"|
81|"I see that $Y's got another one."|
81|"If I weren't, why would you be here?"|
81|"Job? I'm a mender of the @inflicted!"|
81|"Makin' mistakes and expecting their elders to bail them out."|
81|"My name's @Tobatha."|
81|"Now stop this foolishness and tell me what you want, youngster."|
81|"Oh, sure! Thou art just trying to get on my good side."|
81|"That ain't enough money."|
81|"That's @maam to you, youngster. Respect your elders!"|
81|"That's better. Now, what did you want?"|
81|"Then go see a gravedigger. I'll reckon his price'll be lower."|
81|"There ain't no dead person here!"|
81|"Thou art #1 gold piece\s short."|
81|"Thou art not too bad, for a youngster."|
81|"Well if thou won't pay, thou won't get cured!"|
81|"Well, ain't that just like youngsters?"|
81|"Well, if thou wilt not pay, why should I heal thee?"|
81|"Well, it won't work!"|
81|"Well, that's kids today for ye! No manners, the lot of 'em!"|
81|"Well, today's your lucky day."|
81|"Well, what can I do for thee?"|
81|"What do you mean, cure? None of you are poisoned!"|
81|"What do you mean, cure? Thou art not poisoned!"|
81|"What do you mean, heal? None of you are wounded!"|
81|"What do you mean, heal? Thou art not wounded!"|
81|"What else ya want?"|
81|"Who are you and what d'ye want?"|
81|"Wilt thou make an offering of 10 gold?"|
81|"Wilt thou make an offering of 30 gold?"|
81|"Wilt thou make an offering of 400 gold?"|
81|"You youngsters think everything should be free!"|
81|"anretu!"|

81|a doddering old woman.|
82|"'Twas @Gideon questioned them, not I."|
82|"@Quenton, not I, was in charge of its safe keeping."|
82|"@Yorl and that young @Delancy girl can tell you about that."|
82|"A couple of @travelers were staying there that night, but they said they heard nothing."|
82|"A few months ago, a gargoyle attempted to enter the castle proper."|
82|"For the life of me I've never understood a word he's ever said."|
82|"Goodbye."|
82|"He is a very private sort. I've never been to his abode."\n*\n"He lives east of here, along the road to Britain."|
82|"He keeps hearing its deep growl."|
82|"He may be mad, but he is still quick and astute in the ways of magic."|
82|"He runs the @Haunting Inn."|
82|"He said that although they killed the beast, it's horrifying noises still give him @nightmares."|
82|"He works at the pier with the @Delancy girl."|
82|"Huge fierce creatures, they are."|
82|"I am, of course, @Trenton @Bell, the mayor."|
82|"I do not know their names."|
82|"I fail to see how that relates to the matter at hand..."|
82|"I would appreciate if you would use my @title, 'Your @Honor'."|
82|"I'm sure that even if Quenton couldn't scream, someone would have heard that growl."|
82|"Job? I do not @labor like others."|
82|"Just as I suspected, when he died, so too did our chances of finding the rune."|
82|"Many believe if he had screamed, someone in the @inn would have heard him."|
82|"My flock would not fight against anyone."|
82|"Quenton didn't even have time to @scream before one of those beasts had killed him."|
82|"She has run the pier ever since her father, @Quenton, was attacked by a @gargoyle."|
82|"She is a peaceful woman. Very pleasant to talk to."|
82|"Speak to @Horance of that."|
82|"Still, I find this @strange."|
82|"The one the @travelers were at. It's across the way." He frowns at you.|
82|"Therefore, I'm alarmed at the recent @gargoyle sightings."|
82|"They say he drank one too many potions."|
82|"We do not believe in violence as a solution to our problems."|
82|"We were not friends...not good friends, that is. He resented my @position."|
82|"Well, surely thou canst @read, yes?"|
82|"Yes, I am mayor."|
82|"Yes, reading books is good for your spiritual side."|
82|"Yes, well, as mayor, I am the shepherd of the @spiritual people of this hamlet."|
82|"Yes, you see, my brother is a guard for Lord British."|
82|"Yes."|
82|"Yes?"|
82|"Yes?" he asks, reaching over and removing something invisible from your shoulder.|
82|"You aren't much of a sailor are you?"|
82|"You know: @rigging the masts or swabbing the decks."|
82|"You may call me 'Your Honor'."|
82|"You see, he never told anyone where it was located."|
82|"You will have to ask another of that."|
82|"You've forgotten? Well, 'Your @honor' will do."|
82|He coughs then clears his throat.|
82|He sniffs the air as if smelling something bad.|
82|Recognizing you, his smile flickers a moment. "You have come back. Well?"|
82|a tall, rather well dressed man with a wilted smile.|
83|"#0 gold for a room and a meal. Interested?"|
83|"'There is a sting in my eyes, and your name in my cries, but still I realize, that you are part of me.'"|
83|"'You put your love in my heart, and now it's fallen apart, but all alone in the dark, I will remove the pain.'"|
83|"@Gideon, my friend, Gideon's what I'm called by one and all."|
83|"As children we'd take the boats and race around the point."|
83|"Ask someone else about that."|
83|"At first I thought maybe I should lock the @cupboard where we keep the wine."|
83|"But I don't think my Marta's been nippin'. I wish I knew what she saw."|
83|"But now, with what @Marta saw..."|
83|"Come and sit, for you must have many @tales."|
83|"Come back, dear souls."|
83|"Elisabeth bowed her head as they sailed off." He looks absently at the floor and attempts to clear his throat.|
83|"Finally, she could take no more and turned and kissed me."|
83|"Good morning, my friend|
83|"Had he been raised by someone with a good heart, he might have been one of Lord @British's greatest knights."|
83|"He lay so quiet, no sign of pain on his face, and just an @amulet in his bloody hand."|
83|"He lives next door. Strange fellow..."|
83|"He means well, it's just his attitude is all wrong for the job."|
83|"He should spend some time in New @Magincia."|
83|"He was a dear soul." Gideon looks past you into the distance.|
83|"He's been like a father to Marney."|
83|"He's the alchemist who lives on @Iver's Rounding."|
83|"I can still see Elisa's brave face as the men led her to their boat."|
83|"I could not believe it was him by the well." His eyes become watery.|
83|"I couldn't see what it was."|
83|"I have @rooms for let."|
83|"I questioned them about the night of the murder."|
83|"I think he's sampled too much of his own wares."|
83|"I'm just an innkeep. Ask @Yorl: his father used to sail for our ruler."|
83|"I'm sorry, but we require cash in advance for our rooms.\n"|
83|"I'm sure by now you've heard such banter about old Quenton."|
83|"I've heard these beasts eat their prey. Why did they leave Quenton alone then?"|
83|"If you've never had @Stivius' wine, you're in for a treat."|
83|"Is it you, $P?" he says, leaning close and staring you in the eyes.|
83|"It is harder to build your ladder on your own, but you will see farther in the end."|
83|"It took courage to tell her the news."|
83|"It was named after a famous pirate who beached his craft there during a storm."|
83|"Marta and I took care of him when @Mondain's henchmen killed his wife @Elisabeth."|
83|"Marta was there, so beautiful and shy."|
83|"My @wife tells me I spread too many of them around."|
83|"My @wife would say it is to annoy the customers with idle @banter. She's dear."|
83|"My Marta doesn't spook that easy. After all, she's woke up next to me all these years."|
83|"Neither I nor the @travelers staying here heard anything the night he was @killed."|
83|"Now there's a sad soul. He was so young when he got tangled up with the wrong group of kids."|
83|"Of course it is! Welcome back, traveler."|
83|"Our beliefs held us still."|
83|"Perhaps some other time, then.|
83|"She hasn't come out of that room since she saw that darn ghost in the dining room a few nights ago."|
83|"She let out such a @scream that I heard her from our bedroom."|
83|"She told me the lanterns went out and a spectre drifted in front of her."|
83|"She turned and handed @something to her crying little @girl."|
83|"She was an angel to view. Blonde hair, green eyes, tall slender body. Marney could be her twin."|
83|"She's a dear soul. I sometimes feel sorry for her. I mean, her weight and all."|
83|"She, like her mother, is strong in her @beliefs."|
83|"Still, of all of us, my Marta and I had the best vantage point from which to witness, or even hear, the murder."|
83|"Still, she is one of the most interesting people I've ever met."|
83|"That name used to be just words."|
83|"The shrine of Spirituality. It is where we go when we are troubled."|
83|"The truth is, when you tear down another's ladder you become no higher, they just become lower."|
83|"The word I spread is one of kindness to all souls!"|
83|"Then she @boarded the skiff, and they were gone."|
83|"There, I told you, Marta. New people, new food for our souls."|
83|"These evil ones believed that by tearing down others, they could become more powerful."|
83|"They said that after she got them past their pursuers she would be freed." He hides his face in his hands.|
83|"They went around asking for some person named Relthor, or @Renthar... something like that."|
83|"They were fleeing Lord British's men and apparently thought our hamlet was safe haven."|
83|"Tis an old family name meaning 'one who spreads the @word.'"|
83|"We are a peaceful people."|
83|"We believe that all men have hearts that can possess either good or evil."|
83|"We came to this island many years ago."|
83|"We care for his daughter, Marney, now. She's such a brave girl." He pauses a moment then continues.|
83|"We had no such person in this town. Not by that name."|
83|"We sat in silence together for hours."|
83|"We went and told Yorl what had happened."|
83|"When I was a young man I visited the @shrine to contemplate an emptiness I felt inside."|
83|"When he returned with us to the well, he removed the amulet from Quenton's hand and took it to Marney."|
83|"When we buried her father, she sang a song she wrote for him." He softly sings.|
83|"Yes, Quenton and Yorl were out fishing when a few of those evil ones landed here."|
83|"Yes, let us swap stories for a while..."|
83|"Yes."|
83|"Yet we saw and heard nothing."|
83|"You must go see him, down by the pier." He stares absently at your shirt pocket.|
83|"You should sail there someday."|
83|"You should visit it sometime."|
83|"You'll need a boat to get there though."|
83|."|
83|A shout comes from the room behind him.|
83|He answers, "No, @Marta, our guests are not asleep yet."|
83|He looks at the floor and mumbles. "@Quen, I miss you, old mate."|
83|He looks at you a moment, then leans closer. "They say that Quenton was killed by a Gargoyle."|
83|He looks at you, his eyes red and his lip quivering. He simply nods.|
83|He looks at you, then looks over his shoulder and shouts to someone behind him.|
83|He shakes his head and glances at the room behind him.|
83|He turns back to you. "Welcome to the @Haunting @Inn."|
83|His eyes light up "He is one of the friendliest people in this hamlet."|
83|Speaking again, his voice is a whisper. "They found her body along the @coast south of here."|
83|You sleep in a comfortable bed...|
83|You wake rested and eat a large breakfast.|
83|a man bent over with age. An old brown tunic hangs loosely on him.|
83|s|
84|"'Course my path takes me right by @Gideon's garden."|
84|"'Course, they were @kneeling when I saw 'em."|
84|"@Stivius the wine merchant is mine."|
84|"Ask someone else about that."|
84|"Back for some more wine?"|
84|"Come back if you get thirsty."|
84|"Enjoy your $1."|
84|"Everyone knows that @Quenton haunts this town."|
84|"Excellent!" After accepting $Y's gold, $N hands over the wine.|
84|"Gideon runs the Haunting @Inn."|
84|"Go ask old @Horance. He can tell ya - if you can understand him!"|
84|"Go see @Marney, she'll get you there."|
84|"He lives over on @Ivers Rounding by himself.|
84|"He was a nice enough soul. I sold many bottles to him."|
84|"His @wife has a garden which you can see from my front door."|
84|"I couldn't see too clearly. They were about man-@sized though."|
84|"I didn't stay around and count 'em."|
84|"I don't care much for him. He's always trying to get me to sell him my wine cheaper."|
84|"I have never talked to him. He bought wine from me once but that's it."|
84|"I heard a @noise by the well and saw some @dark forms hunched there."|
84|"I make @wine."|
84|"I ran like the wind to my doorway. I was sure I was dead."|
84|"If I had been @murdered by those evil ones...but that's just gossip."|
84|"It didn't sound like any language I ever heard."|
84|"It was late one night and I had just returned from my fields."|
84|"It's not just a @tale you've been hearing."|
84|"It's the Inn straight across the lane from here."|
84|"Like the one the @alchemist speaks."|
84|"More like one o' them guild @languages."|
84|"Must'a been ten or @twelve of 'em."|
84|"Quite a name, eh?"|
84|"She doesn't do much. Helps him run the place."|
84|"She's my sweetie."|
84|"She's the daughter of @Quenton - the ghost."|
84|"They had huge wings and @evil red eyes."|
84|"Too bad, it's really good wine."|
84|"Twas a strange @whispering, in a tongue I could not understand."|
84|"Well, perhaps more like two or three."|
84|"Well, what's to say? I am glad he is again our ruler."|
84|"What can I do you for?"|
84|"Which item?"|
84|"Which of you?"|
84|"Yeah. Maybe you want to buy some."\n*|
84|"Yeah. Ok. Yeah."|
84|"Yes, but they were hunched down so it was hard to see them."|
84|"Yes. Big, ugly, snarling beasts."|
84|"You know, on their knees."|
84|"You look pretty full to me."|
84|"You must be new to this village."|
84|#0. $0|
84|#2. $Y|
84|$N looks at $Y. "You don't have enough gold."|
84|$N smiles at $Y. "For $0 it will cost you #1 gold. Interested?"|
84|(|
84|Dry Wine|
84|He clasps his hands next to his cheek. "I count the hours until I can see her."|
84|He looks you up and down and then claps his hands together. "Yeah. Ok. Yeah."|
84|His eyes widen. "@Gargoyles they were!"|
84|Red Wine|
84|Skara Dry|
84|Skara Red|
84|Sweet Wine|

84|a tiny little man with wild eyes.|
84|d|
84|s|
85|"Another strange man. We have so many here."|
85|"Goodbye."|
85|"He never comes into town."|
85|"He's a messy person - and smelly too."|
85|"Hello again. Are you well $T?"|
85|"Hello. How are you this $T?"|
85|"I cut myself one time in the garden. She healed it."|
85|"I want to move from this house as soon as we can."|
85|"It is a plain name, but I must live with it."|
85|"It was the scariest thing I ever saw! I'm sure it's still lurking about somewhere..."|
85|"Marta."|
85|"My dear little one? She is an angel - well minded, kind, thoughtful."|
85|"My husband talks a bit too much, but I love him."|
85|"Nasty creatures, or so I hear. Can stomp a garden to pieces in minutes."|
85|"Oh dear, my husband runs the inn. I tend my @garden."|
85|"Red as the evening sun on the sea."|
85|"She's a dear."|
85|"What is it you need?"|
85|"You will have to ask another that."|
85|"You've not seen it? I have the loveliest @roses."|
85|a rather plump woman with darting eyes.|
86|"'Specially one as small as him."|
86|"'Tisn't quite as exciting as some jobs, but it keeps me near the @sea."|
86|"@Gideon and @Stivius."|
86|"A @pole'll never catch you enough to sell."|
86|"Ah!" He rumbles up to you with a large, bloody hook.|
86|"And when they do, I'll be waitin' for 'em with my @nets!"|
86|"Anyhow, that's when I lost my father."|
86|"Anyway, Quen and I 'cided we'd catch us one in our @skiff."|
86|"Anyway, we rowed out past Ivers @Rounding and sat in our skiff waiting to see one."|
86|"Anyway, we sat there for hours with 'nary a sign of life..."|
86|"As it came closer, a huge wave preceded it and we could make out a giant mouth."|
86|"Aye, you haveta use nets to do serious fishing."|
86|"But 'nary a single gargoyle." He looks out towards the sea.|
86|"But don't let that out."|
86|"But they'll come back!"|
86|"Came up all of a sudden. I say it was @Mondain's doing."|
86|"Even if the @fishing's been poor of late."|
86|"Fish come, fish go. Right now, the fish have gone."|
86|"Good $T, friend." He extends a huge hand which resembles a slab of meat.|
86|"He and I were mates. I can still remember the moment @they told me he was dead."|
86|"He owns the Haunting Inn. He's good people, though his @wife is a bit of a nag."|
86|"He said the fish had a glowing horn on it's snout."|
86|"He's a strange little guy. They say he's the only one who saw Quen murdered."|
86|"He's a stuffy one. Never likes to come down here, says it smells."|
86|"I can't imagine why. The sea was his lifeblood."|
86|"I don't much care for that one. He used to be one of Mondain's henchmen."|
86|"I know it sounds crazy now, but you have to remember, we were only boys."|
86|"I never seen a one."|
86|"I seen alot o' things out at sea, @serpents as big as the biggest four-@master."|
86|"I tell you if she comes around here, I'll show her what an eyesore really is!"|
86|"I tell you, you've never seen two boys make a skiff travel so fast in all your life."|
86|"I think @Stivius has been drinkin' his profits."|
86|"I took it from Quenton's dead body to give to Marney for safe keeping."|
86|"I wish we'd had a better witness." He flips the hook over and over examining it.|
86|"I'd plot a course 'round him if I were you."|
86|"I'm a fisherman."|
86|"I'm her father now. And if any man should want her hand, he'd better be able to take me square!"|
86|"It only comes close to the surface when the sea is like @glass."|
86|"It was a calm night, it was."|
86|"Man's gotta make a living!"|
86|"My @father was a coastal @raider."|
86|"My father used to sail in one of his fleets. A brave and mighty ruler he is."|
86|"Never mind." He sticks his hands in his apron.|
86|"Never use 'em myself. I stick to nets--faster and easier."|
86|"Not just any fish, mind ya, a @light-horn."|
86|"Oh, aye, love the sea I do."|
86|"Old Horance? He's a crazy old coot who lives on the isle."|
86|"One o' the tall ships. My father used to pilot one o' the biggest in Lord @British's fleet."|
86|"Quen and I had 'cided to go out on that glassy sea for a fish."|
86|"Said if a body could @catch one, good fortune would be his."|
86|"She always complains that my house is an @eyesore."|
86|"She'd seen many a battle with pirates. Then she went to her grave in a @storm."|
86|"She's a heavily rigged one, she is." He winks at you and laughs.|
86|"She's the loveliest thing ever seen in these parts."|
86|"Still, those Gargoyles would frighten any man."|
86|"That doesn't concern me. Ask another."|
86|"That's a @tale they tell in town. I've seen no spirits. Except at old Stivius'."|
86|"The Merideth @Ann. She was a sight to behold, she was."|
86|"Then, suddenly, in the distance we could see a tall @neck rising out of the water and heading towards us."|
86|"They came to my house before dawn and told me that Quen had been killed by @gargoyles."|
86|"They say that @Quen's ghost haunts that area of town."|
86|"This is a fishhouse. It's meant to be an eyesore." He laughs again.|
86|"Took nearly two hundred men with her."|
86|"Well, even though the skiff was small, we figured that we'd @spear the beast and drag it back to port."|
86|"What do ya need?"|
86|"When we were boys, Quen's father often talked about such a fish."|
86|"Where have you been @scuttled? That's too long a story for this $T."|
86|"Who told you?"|
86|"Yes, I had one." He hollers again, this time slapping you on the back.|
86|"Yes, good fortune."|
86|"Yorl. A short name, but a @strong one!"|
86|"You know, 'bout @Marn's pa haunting the @vineyard."|
86|"You know, past where the @alchemist lives."|
86|"You see, the fish thought the surface was a mirror and it came up to admire its horn."|
86|He brings the pipe to his lips and lights it.|
86|He chuckles to himself, teeth clenched around the pipe.|
86|He gives you a huge grin and flexes a massive bicep.|
86|He laughs out loud, this time bending over to support himself.|
86|He leans closer wiping his hands on his apron.|
86|He lets out a holler and laughs loudly.|
86|He looks out to sea again and chuckles.|
86|He pauses for a moment and looks distantly past your shoulder.|
86|He pulls a pipe out of his apron.|
86|He pulls the pipe from his mouth and blows some smoke rings.|
86|He pulls the pipe from his mouth and tamps the tobacco with his stout thumb.|
86|He removes a large hook from his pocket and begins to clean it as he talks.|
86|He slaps a hand on your back "Good fortune, and may the wind be at your back."|
86|He slaps you on the back and laughs.|
86|He smells strongly of fish.|
86|He stops trying to relight his pipe and looks at you.|
86|He suddenly stops laughing and looks at you, his eyes angry and wide.|
86|He swallows hard and his eyes become glassy. "I miss old Quen."|
86|He takes his pipe from his mouth and gestures at you.|
86|He turns his head back towards you, purses his lips, then speaks.|
86|With that he throws his head back and laughs again.|
86|You feel like bolting, but then he drops it in a pocket on his apron and extends a bloody hand.|

87|"@Dezana." She smiles like a cat preparing for a meal.|
87|"A nice fellow, but a bit too simple for me."|
87|"A quaint little man. He has strong feelings for me."|
87|"Although his ghost can hear your questions, he'll respond by @manipulating the environment."|
87|"And I believe he has..."|
87|"As you wish."|
87|"Certainly he would have tasted just as good."|
87|"Dezana knows much. Have you returned for more @talk or are you in @need?"|
87|"Doman..."|
87|"He discovered something else, however: that total knowledge can corrupt totally."|
87|"He had attained much wisdom before he was forced from here."|
87|"He is a dear old man. Never has a mean thing to say of anyone."|
87|"He is a very stiff man. I believe he may be hiding something about his past."|
87|"He never talks about his past."|
87|"He was once a great man. Discovered many of the herbs I use in healing."|
87|"I can @heal, @cure, and even @resurrect."|
87|"I don't know what drove him mad. And I don't want to know." She shudders slightly.|
87|"I know something about everyone in this village. However, this man is unknown to me."|
87|"I know this much: if you wish to find out who murdered him, you won't be able to ask his ghost."|
87|"I must admit, he has a cute way about him."|
87|"I see that $Y carries a departed friend."|
87|"I see that $Y carries another slain friend."|
87|"I see thy injury, $Y."|
87|"If his ghost has been seen..."|
87|"Is there something else I can do for you?"|
87|"It is a mystical place between here and the hereafter. Quenton resides there."|
87|"It is not my place to talk about that."|
87|"It will cost you 30 gold, interested?"|
87|"It'll cost you 10 gold, interested?"|
87|"Many are intriguing, some are even dangerous. What words have you heard?"|
87|"Mmm...yes?" She looks down at you, her eyes merely slits.|
87|"None of you look hurt!"|
87|"Perhaps he knows who @killed him."|
87|"Perhaps you have a hangover, 'cause none of you are poisoned."|
87|"Resurrection costs 400 gold, interested?"|
87|"Return when you need healing."|
87|"She has seen much pain in her life. More than even I can heal. I pity her."|
87|"So why, then, did the gargoyles not attack @Stivius as well?"|
87|"Some are lost souls, others have a purpose. @Quenton is not a lost @soul."|
87|"That is correct. Now, are you here to @chat, or are you in @need?"|
87|"That is one worth speaking about. You see, many people travel the @spirit world."|
87|"Then he must be attempting to communicate with us about some unfinished business."|
87|"There are many words which travel about this small hamlet."|
87|"They are as children left alone in a crib. Never learning, always seeking."|
87|"They spent their whole life without learning anything or growing inside."|
87|"Those creatures are dangerous. I have heard that they can tear a man to pieces."|
87|"What? But you carry no dead body!"|
87|"Yes, you know, make him demonstrate his answers by, say, shaking a branch."|
87|"Yes? What is thy need--@healing, @curing or @resurrection?"|
87|"You don't have enough gold."|
87|"You don't look poisoned."|
87|"You look fine to me."|
87|"You look poisoned to me." She nods at $Y.|
87|"You might think about a proper burial."|
87|"You must pay before I can heal you."|
87|"You see, the spirit world can not communicate with ours directly."|

89|"@Gideon had been a friend of theirs since youth."|
89|"A basket? I have one in my hope chest. Feel free to look for yourself."|
89|"After he died, we had no way of finding out where he put it."|
89|"After my mother was kidnapped, Yorl helped my father get back on his feet."|
89|"Ah, now, Horance is much wiser than most know."|
89|"At first we met and dark clouds gathered, the thunder sounding your approach."|
89|"Be sure to return it, though!"|
89|"But I am sure there is a reason for it."|
89|"Certainly you can look at it." She hands the tiny cloth to you.|
89|"Had he been drinking, @Yorl would have been with him."|
89|"He and his wife are very kind to me. They have taught me so much about how to treat others."|
89|"He has a way of reminding me that I am too concerned with myself."|
89|"He is a sweet little man. He brought me wine on my sixteenth birthday."|
89|"He is also my mentor when it comes to poetry."|
89|"Hello $G, welcome to my home."|
89|"I am sorry for our town. You see, my father was the caretaker of the rune stone."|
89|"I am sorry that I wept. It is not your fault. Goodbye."|
89|"I believe he has done all he can for me."|
89|"I can not see why those beasts would kill him, but perhaps it was just unfortunate."|
89|"I look after the @dock."|
89|"I recognize you from before." She winks at you.|
89|"I saw him once when I was a little girl."|
89|"I see him only occasionally when he comes into town."|
89|"I wish I were as beautiful as she."|
89|"I'm quite fond of him."|
89|"If my @father had been drinking at the @inn, Yorl would have been there."|
89|"It is a gentle way, but a firm reminder."|
89|"It is in a @poem my mother wrote to him when they first met."|
89|"It is something I care not to talk about. His memory brings only sadness to me."|
89|"It means the cool breeze after a storm has passed. @Marney."|
89|"My father and Yorl would go there after a good catch."|
89|"My father chose an ancient word for my name."|
89|"My father had gone out to help @Yorl bring in the catch that afternoon."|
89|"My father? He was a brave man and very strong."|
89|"My mother gave me this just before she was taken by those evil men."|
89|"My mother told me to give it to father when he returned from the @sea."|
89|"None were found though."|
89|"Oh, Yorl." She smiles to herself. "He and father were never apart."|
89|"Oh, you're probably wanting a skiff to get out to old Horance's island."|
89|"She bakes for me and we have long talks about almost everything."|
89|"She has done as much as she can to heal my wounded heart."|
89|"Still, I can't see why he was at the inn that late."|
89|"That he died in such a violent way was so wrong."|
89|"The three would would drink and reminisce together."|
89|"Then comes the storm of our hearts pounding and in the end the marney's touch."|
89|"They were always together." Her gaze returns to you.|
89|"We had gone to his castle for a celebration and there he sat on a great white charger."|
89|"Well, we have none for sale, but feel free to borrow the one at the dock."|
89|"What a sight he was."|
89|"What can I do for you?"|
89|"When my father was murdered, he took charge to find the gargoyles."|
89|"Yorl gave it back to me after he was @killed.|
89|As you ask this, she begins to cry.Gathering her strength she looks at you. "Sorry?"|
89|Her blue eyes glisten with new-formed tears.|
89|Her eyes are as blue as the ocean and her movements as rythmic as the tide.|
89|Her eyes brighten at the mention of his name. "He is a very handsome man."|
89|Inside a @basket made of promise,|
89|Inside is a folded piece of cloth with words printed on it. She begins to read.|
89|Looking at it, you discover that she has read only the first verse of the poem.|
89|Remember where my love is kept:|
89|She bows her head a moment and with a shaky voice begins to speak.|
89|She grabs a @locket that hangs around her neck and opens it.|
89|She looks absently out the window. "Yorl would never let me see him though."|
89|She looks at you and swallows. "I cannot talk about these creatures."|
89|She rubs her nose with the knuckle of her hand.|
89|The second reads, "If I should leave and you are lonely,|
89|You'll find my dreams of us have slept."|
89|a tall, delicate looking female. Her smile puts you at ease.*|
90|"All men have enemies. A @debt needed to be settled."|
90|"An annoying little man. Makes good wine though."|
90|"Are you taking a @census?" His powerful gaze is fixed on you.|
90|"Have you ever seen one?"|
90|"He hadn't the strength to settle it, so someone decided to take the initiative."|
90|"He is a fool. The perfect man for his job."|
90|"He is a mighty warrior, as well as a just opponent."|
90|"He is one to be respected. I have seen him fight, firsthand."|
90|"He was not fortunate. It is written that it is better to be fortunate than skilled."|
90|"He, I'm sure, would agree." His face betrays a slight grin.|
90|"I don't know him."|
90|"If you had you would not believe the fairy tales "being told by that incompetent mayor."|
90|"Perhaps the wisest of us all."|
90|"She is kind to me, and yet I believe this is genuine."|
90|"Since I have none, refrain from its use."|
90|"Speak," he growls at you, his voice as rough and cold as stone.|
90|"Surely you don't buy the fable of the @gargoyle."|
90|"That is a concern of the town, not mine."|
90|"That name is given to friends so that they may feel they are close to me."|
90|"Their fangs are twice as long and thrice as sharp."|
90|"There wouldn't be enough left to bury if this were the case."|
90|"This was no monster who settled the debt, it was the work of man's hands."|
90|"Too kind for his own good."|
90|"Yes, you know, counting people, taking down names..."|
90|He brings the knife to his teeth and delicately works it between them.|
90|He grabs the knife and holds it aloft. "See this blade?"|
90|He ignores the question and you think it wise not to ask again.|
90|He pulls out a knife and begins to pick at his nails.|
90|He resumes cleaning his nails with his knife.|

91|A whirlpool of leaves, twigs and stones whips up around you.|
91|A wind from behind blows your hair, covering your eyes.|
91|His mouth moves, yet no words can be heard...|
91|The form is that of a man.|
91|The ghostly image shimmers for a moment and then he points a boney finger to his neck.|
91|The spectre's arm thrusts again, this time.|
91|The spectre's arm thrusts out, pointing to the @sea.|
91|This time you see it points towards the pier.|
91|You hear no answer save the rustle of the leaves on the ground around you.|
91|You speak the word and the spectre responds by pointing a boney hand to his @eye.|
91|You suddenly smell the scent of a storm approaching.|
91|Your clothing is yanked by the strong wind forcing you to grip it tightly in your hands.|
91|a vaporous form hovering before you.|

92|"Greetings, $P! What brings thee here this $T?"|

92|"I do @magic tricks. It brings a bit of cheer into this imperfect world."|

92|"I knew you would. That's my favorite trick!"|
92|"Keep asking around."|
92|"My name is Antonio."|
92|"Splendid!" Antonio reaches into his pocket and takes out a balloon.\n*\nHe blows it up until it bursts, and four doves appear from inside it, flying off towards the four points of the compass.*\n\n"Did you enjoy that?"|
92|"The city of @humility is a lovely place to live."|
92|"The most @humble one amongst us knows the mantra."\n*\n"If thou canst find out who that is, tell me, and I will give thee the rune."*|
92|"The pleasure is all mine."|
92|"Then prithee, what is it?"|
92|"Then what is that person's name?"|
92|"Too bad. Perhaps I should learn a better trick."|
92|"Until we meet again, may your road be short and your fortunes long."|
92|"Very astute of thee! Here is the rune, and I wish thee success on thy mission."|
92|"Wouldst thou like to see one?"|
92|#|
92|a gentleman of slight build and refined manners.\n*|
93|"Ask @Antonio."|
93|"Can't help you there."|
93|"He's a mighty foolish fellow."|
93|"Howdy, stranger."|
93|"I'll show ya one."\n*\nThe old man gets a fiendish gleam in his eyes as he reaches into his pouch and takes out a small wooden hippo.\n*\n"Aint she purty?"\n*\n"If I don't make the purtiest gol' danged hippos you ever did see, you can call me @Mortimer."|
93|"I'm a @farmer."|
93|"M'name is William."|
93|"See ya."|
93|"That's where ya are now."|
93|"The lord of New @Magincia."|
93|"Working the earth is the lowest form 'o labor."\n*\n"But it provides food for them as writes books, plays music, and other such things."\n*\n"Surely 'tis a humble living, to devote yer life to farmin'."\n*\n"It's about all I do with meself, 'cept when I find time for carvin' @hippos."|
93|an old farmer who looks to have has made his peace with life.\n*|
94|"Good $T. Is there anything I can do for you?"|
94|"Hello, $P. It's good to see you again."|
94|"I am a fisherman. In catching @fish, as in all of life, there is something to be learned."|
94|"I am satisfied to live here and learn what I can from the fish."|
94|"I can't help you with that."|
94|"I no longer follow the way of the warrior."|
94|"I still have not mastered the @way of the fisherman."\n*\n"But I think perhaps the key to enlightenment lies not so much in the destination as in the road one travels."|
94|"I used to be a guildmaster. But that was long ago."|
94|"If I can help you with anything else, let me know."|
94|"It's down at the beach. Feel free to borrow it if you have need."|
94|"Oh, forgive me for not introducing myself. I am Conor Starfalcon. And what is your name?"|
94|"The Mantra of Humility is 'lum'. If you seek the @shrine, I hope you find it."|
94|"The Shrine of Humility is far to the southeast."\n*\n"I'd be glad to take you there in my @boat, but I'm afraid it is too small to weather the high seas."|
94|"We've met before. But that was many @years ago."|
94|"Well met, $G!"|
94|"Yes, long ago."|
94|"You seek to find the humblest in New Magincia? That's a difficult task."\n*\n"I'd hate to commend one of my neighbors to you and fail to do justice to the others."\n*\n"The one thing I can tell you for certain is that it isn't me you're looking for."|
94|#|
94|You think you see a brief flicker of recognition pass between @Iolo and the fisherman.\n*\nBut before you can be certain, he turns to address you.\n*|
94|a stalwart fellow, with a look of placid concentration.\n*|
95|"'Tis really not my place to speak of that, $G."|
95|"As you wish, $G."|
95|"As you wish..."|
95|"Aye, $Y, I can weave thy silk thread into cloth."|
95|"Aye, $Y, I will buy wool from thee..."|
95|"Begging thy pardon, $G, but I see no silk!"|
95|"Begging thy pardon, $Y, but thou dost not have 10 gold!"|
95|"Begging thy pardon, but I see no wool!"|
95|"But 'twould make thee o'erburdened, $Y!"|
95|"But honesty is a virtue too, and honesty forces me to admit that I am the humblest person in New Magencia."|
95|"But thou hast not enough gold, $Y!"|
95|"Come to my shop when I'm open!"|
95|"Done!" $N hands $Y 10 gold pieces and takes the wool.|
95|"Farewell, $G!"|
95|"Finished!" She takes $Y's gold and hands over the cloth.|
95|"Good $T, $G."|

95|"I am not very good, but some people take pity on me and buy my @cloth anyway."|
95|"I can weave that @silk for thee... Then thou should speak with @Marissa."|
95|"I turn @wool into cloth."|
95|"I'm not sure what you mean."|
95|"If you had some @silk thread, I could help thee. Go ask @Arbeth if he has any to spare."|
95|"It will cost thee 10 gold. Interested?"|
95|"Many thanks!"\n\nAfter accepting $Y's gold, $N hands over the cloth.|
95|"My cloth costs 25 gold. Interested, $Y?"|
95|"Perhaps some other time, then."|
95|"She lives in Paws."|
95|"Take the cloth to @Marissa. Mayhap she can sew it into a bag for thee."|
95|"Thou knowest best, $Y."|
95|"Which of you?"|
95|"Will you take 10 gold crowns for a bale of wool, $Y?"|
95|"Wouldst thou like some cloth?"|

95|Turning to her loom, Charlotte soon weaves the thread into fine silk cloth.|

96|"For that I charge a modest #1 gold. Want some?"|
96|"Go see for yourself."|
96|"Here you go."|

103|"He is nice to me." he stops wringing his hands and seems to relax momentarily.|
103|"He lives here in Paws and is a fine weaver."|
103|"He's alright, I guess."|

103|"Well," he says so quietly you have to lean close to hear, "I make @wool into @thread."|
103|"What do you want from me?"|
103|"What? Oh, yes, I could spin spidersilk into thread. Do you want me to?"|
103|"Which of you?"|

103|"Will you take 6 gold for that wool?"|

103|"Yes?" he asks, looking like he expects to be beaten any minute.|

104|"But ya don't have any grain!"|

105|"I like to go on walks with Uby. He has such an interesting life."|

110|"A friend of Taynith's, are you? Here, have one on the house." He hands you an ale.\n*|
110|"A nice place to visit, eh?"|
110|"Ah, I see you've brought me a tasty little mouse to feed my @pets..."|
110|"Anything else I can do for you?"|
110|"Are you friends of that deadbeat? He owes me for more drinks than I care to think about."\n*\n"The only reason I give him food and drink is because he can't sing with his mouth full!"|
110|"Come by the Cat's Lair when I'm open for business."|
110|"Don't get the two gypsy bands mixed up... Taynith travels with @Zoltan."\n*\n"The other group are a bunch of pickpockets and scallawags..."|
110|"Don't worry, I was just kidding... Any friend of Lord British is a friend of mine."\n*|

110|"I guess you can call yourself king of anything, if nobody comes along to dispute it..."|
110|"I like the name of the town too, of course!"|
110|"I sell @ale, @mead, @wine, @milk, and @mutton. Of course I like to chat with my @patrons, and indulge in a friendly @game every now and then."|
110|"I sell the finest mutton, and for only 3 gold per serving. How many servings do you want?"|
110|"I think I've got time for a quick game of Nim..."\n*|

110|"My name's Dr. @Cat."|
110|"Put down some stuff, $Y, so you can carry some gold!"|
110|"She lives in Britain."|
110|"Taynith bet me one time I couldn't catch a duck with my bare hands."\n*\n"So I did, and had a leash made for it, so I could give it to her as a pet."\n*\n"I doubt she still has it, though. I saw @Zoltan eyeing it hungrily..."|
110|"Taynith is my dearest friend. Her @gypsy band travels the King's Way."\n*\n"Once a week, she stops in to say hello."|
110|"Tell you what... I'm in a reckless mood. This time you can bet as much as you like."\n*\n"|
110|"That's #1 crowns. Want some?"|
110|"That's a little steep for a friendly game. Let's just make it 50 crowns."\n*|

110|"That's all you can carry."|
110|"That's too bad. I'd pay well for it."|

110|"Very good! you purr almost as well as @Kytyn."|
110|"We start with ten pieces." He takes some colorful glass beads out of his pocket.\n*\n"Each player takes turns, taking one, two or three beads out of the pile."\n*\n"Whoever gets the last one wins!"\n*|
110|"Welcome to the Cat's Lair."|
110|"Well done! You got the last bead."|
110|"Well, maybe after you've had a few practice games."\n*|
110|"Which of you?"|
110|"Which, @ale, @mead, @wine, @milk, or @mutton?"|
110|"Would you care to wager on the outcome, just to keep things interesting?"|
110|"Yes, Zoltan, @king of the gypsies!"|
110|"You don't have room to carry it."|
110|"You don't have that much...|
110|"You must be mistaken."|

111|"Can't talk now, $G." He pauses to punch another pirate in the belly.|
111|"Captain John, that lunatic?"|
111|"Come back later when I've less on my mind!"|
111|"Don't go too far, matey--ye'll fall off!" He laughs a hearty laugh and takes a swig of ale.|
111|"Hello, $G. Your company is welcome."|
111|"I can't help ye with that."|
111|"I hear he went @underground seeking the @gargoyles, but he fled from the first one he encountered."\n*\n"Nobody knows where he is now."|
111|"I sail the wide, wide sea, to the edges of the @world and back again."|
111|"I'm @Captain Fox, of the Silken @Stag."|
111|"Of course, I'm also known for the @paintings I create in my spare time."|
111|"There are a few of them around here. Go see for yourself."|
111|"Tough creatures. My crew and I steer well clear of them."|
111|"Under the earth is no place for a seafaring man to be."|
111|"Until we meet again."|
111|"We just stopped off here for some supplies and a @drink or two."|
111|"Well, maybe three wouldn't hurt."|
111|"Well, that's not what I heard." says Leodon.|
111|He continues laughing as he pours himself another ale.|
111|When they realize you weren't talking to them, they go back to what they were doing.|
111|When you say 'Captain,' all the pirates at the table turn to you expectantly.|
111|Your question makes him laugh suddenly. His ale spills across the table.|
111|a handsome gentleman, immaculately dressed.|
112|"A fair sized island, and now she's gone! Some o' them @earthquakes have been mighty fierce."|
112|"Ah, that's not important."|
112|"Aye, 'tis quite a @temptation."|
112|"Aye, 'twas a terrible ordeal. We were sailing just off @Bordermarch when the whole island started @shaking."|
112|"Can't talk now. I'm--ungh!" He reels from a punch to his belly.|
112|"Captain John, that fool... He was captured by gargoyles."|
112|"Hello." His gaze darts from side to side, lingering longingly on the mugs of ale his fellow patrons are gulping down heartily.|
112|"I could use more virtue in me life. I've just given up @drinking, to start with."|
112|"I hear they dragged him down into Hythloth, and nobody's seen hide nor hair of him since."|
112|"I lost my ship to the last one."|
112|"I was Captain of the Theodosia Marie--until she @sank."|
112|"I was one of the lucky few to swim clear. But my ship's on the bottom of the ocean now, and that's the honest truth."|
112|"I was wondering--do you know the @Mantra of Honesty?"|
112|"I wish I had one of them... I bet I could sell it for a pretty penny!"|
112|"I'd toast him with you, but this," he gestures disparagingly at his cup, "is hardly fitting for such an honor."|
112|"I'll be here with the money if you change your mind."|
112|"I'll give you five gold if you tell me. Is it a deal?"|
112|"I'm in the middle of something, $G. Ouch!"|
112|"I've been trying to find out what it is, so that I can better myself."|
112|"Indeed." He takes another big gulp of tea.|
112|"It was all anyone was talking about round here for weeks."|
112|"Must have been one of those @earthquakes we've been having."|
112|"Oh. Well, let me know if you find out later."|
112|"Okay, what is it?"|
112|"Surely you've heard tales of the Avatar's bold exploits?"|
112|"Thank you! Now my meditations will succeed at last!"|
112|"The whole island sank beneath the waves. We were caught in the huge @whirlpool left in its wake."|
112|"Wait, before you go..."|
112|"Well, I'm still Captain Elad."|
112|"Yes, they started soon after Lord @British was @rescued from the underworld."|
112|"You don't hear much about the @virtues in a pirate town..."|
112|As you turn to leave, you think you might have caught a glimpse of Captain Elad stealing a swig from someone else's mug... But you can't be sure.|
112|He looks at you uneasily. "I'm @Captain Elad. Not that it's any business of yours..."|
112|He shudders, then takes a sip of his tea. "I don't like to think about it."|
112|Leonna raises an eyebrow. "Is that so? I could tell a different tale..."|
112|The pirate frowns.|
112|The pirate smiles and waves goodbye, then scowls as he turns back to his mug of tea.|
112|When they realize you weren't talking to them, they return to their business.|
112|When you say 'Captain,' all the pirates at the table turn to you expectantly.|
112|an uncomfortable looking man sitting behind a cup of tea.|
113|"A good $T to you, $G. Come, have a seat and talk with us a while."|
113|"Ah, the sea. 'Tis as vast as a thousand @dreams."|
113|"Alas, the Hind needs serious @repairs just now."|
113|"Aye, Leonna is the best first mate I've ever had."|
113|"Back to our quest, eh $G?"|
113|"But if you ask one of them to @leave first, I'd be happy to join you."|
113|"Comes from being a captain once herself, you know."|
113|"Drop by again next time you're in town."|
113|"He went down to the other side of the world to join up with the @gargoyles, the dirty traitor..."|
113|"I can tell you the truth about Captain John!"|
113|"I can't help you with that."|
113|"I'd be glad to join you--but I have already!"|
113|"I'd have to @join you before I could leave, silly!"|
113|"I'm @Captain Leodon."|
113|"I'm captain of the @Golden @Hind."|
113|"Indeed."|
113|"Let's get our feet back on solid ground first, okay?"|
113|"Life on the @sea is the only life for me."|
113|"Not now, $G!" She ducks a punch. "I'm busy!"|
113|"Not while you're in that thing!"|
113|"Okay. I think I'll head back to the Fallen Virgin, then."\n*\n"Here's all the equipment I was carrying, if you need it."|
113|"Okay. I'll be here if you change your mind."|
113|"One of them attacked  my ship once. He flew off with a @ham before anyone could stop him."|
113|"Perhaps I could @join thy party for a time."|
113|"She's the finest ship I've ever had the pleasure of @sailing 'cross the briny deep."|
113|"That scallawag?"|
113|"That's right."|
113|"The Golden Hind won't be repaired for months, at the soonest."|
113|"Traveling with you would likely prove interesting."|
113|"Very well. This should make a nice change from my usual routine."|
113|"Vile creatures, they are."|
113|"Would you like me to come along?"|
113|"Yes, $P?"|
113|"Yes, I must keep myself occupied on land, meantime."|
113|"Yes, he stole my ham, and I dined on @biscuits that night."|
113|"You have enough travelling with you already."|
113|"You might ask @Leonna if she would like to join us as well."|
113|"You wouldn't be talking about Captain @John, would you?"|
113|Leonna blushes and looks away, embarassed.|
113|The tea-drinker interrupts. "No, no, you've got it all wrong!"|
113|When they realize you weren't talking to them, they return to their business.|
113|When you say 'Captain,' all the pirates at the table turn to you expectantly.|
113|a woman with a slightly seaworn look, but delicate hands.|
114|"A fine old vessel, the Golden Hind."|
114|"Alas, I have little to do while she's being @repaired."|
114|"But I fell on hard times, and now I sail with @Leodon on the @Hind."|
114|"But if you ask one of them to @leave first, I'd be happy to join you."|
114|"Captain John is a madman!"|
114|"Captain who? I know lots of Captains..."|
114|"Could I join your party, perhaps?"|
114|"He went down in Hythloth seeking a way to the other side of the world."|
114|"I can't help you with that."|
114|"I used to @captain my own ship."|
114|"I'd be glad to join you--but I have already!"|
114|"I'd have to @join you before I could leave, silly!"|
114|"Let's get our feet back on solid ground first, okay?"|
114|"My name is Leonna."|
114|"Not while you're in that thing!"|
114|"Oh good! I bet we'll meet a lot of interesting men..."|
114|"Oh, you must be $P, the famous Avatar! 'Tis an honor to meet thee."|
114|"Okay. I guess I'll just stay here for now."|
114|"Okay. I'll go wait back at the Fallen Virgin."\n*\n"You're more likely to need this equipment than I am."\n*\nShe sets down everything she was carrying before walking off.|
114|"Please, let's not talk about them."|
114|"Said he was going to kill as many @gargoyles as he could before they got him."|
114|"Talk to you later."|
114|"That's not true!" says Captain Fox. "I can tell you what really happened."|
114|"There's none I'd rather ship out with."|
114|"Yes, $P?"|
114|"You have enough traveling with you already."|
114|Her face lights up as she recognizes you. "Hello again, $P!"|
114|When they realize you weren't talking to them, they return to their business.|
114|When you say 'Captain,' all the pirates at the table turn to you expectantly.|
114|You fail to get her attention in the midst of the brawl.|
114|a smartly dressed woman. Her smile has a delightful subtlety to it.|
115|"|
115|"$Z? It seems to me I knew something about that, but I'm having trouble with my remembering."|
115|"All right, maybe you've got what it takes. We'll see."|
115|"Come now, that's a little much don't you think?"|
115|"Do you need to buy some supplies?"|
115|"Don't be ridiculous! This is the first time we've ever been in your shop!" says Dupre.|
115|"Good $T!|
115|"Her hideout is deep below Britain, in the sewers. You'd best watch out for the rats down there!"|
115|"I can offer you the standard member's discount on all supplies now."|
115|"I don't know what it is, but I've got one on order."|
115|"I like honey."|
115|"I never seem to sell anything on Tuesdays."|
115|"I think someone told me that was @Nick's name."|
115|"I think you have less gold than you thought."|
115|"I'll talk to you when you get back."|
115|"I'm afraid it still hasn't arrived.|
115|"I'm not sure what 'this' and 'that' are, but I @sell a lot of them!"|
115|"I've never met him, myself."|
115|"If you want one of them, you have to 'retire' a member of the guild."|
115|"If you were to tell anyone I'm involved with the guild, well..."|
115|"It's not as sweet as @honey, but you can trade one for the other."|
115|"Just remember, whatever you do, don't tell anyone about our @guild!"|
115|"Let's just say accidents can happen to anyone--even the Avatar."|
115|"Lucky for you, it just happens there's a member we'd like to see 'retired' soon."|
115|"Now get out of my shop."|
115|"Now we have a limited membership, so there's only so many belts in the world."|
115|"Oh, I sell this and that."|
115|"Oh, I'm sorry. I must have thought you were somebody you aren't.|
115|"One last thing... It\nwould be an embarassment for the guild to have bodies turning up inconveniently."|
115|"People give me @money for them, that is."|
115|"So don't get too violent unless you have to."|
115|"Some call me 'the @Den', but I don't think that's my name."|
115|"Ta ta for now."|
115|"That's all you can afford."|
115|"That's all you can carry."|
115|"Then it must be Thursday--or possibly Tuesday."|
115|"Then just remember this. I don't take kindly to anyone spreading secrets around."|
115|"There you go."|
115|"To be a member of the thieves' guild, you have to get your own belt."|
115|"To keep the guild safe, each member only knows the names of two others."|
115|"Uh-huh. Well... Were you hoping to join?"|
115|"What can I do you for?"|
115|"Which of you?"|
115|"Which, @torches, @oil, @lockpicks, @gems, @backpacks, @bags, @shovels, or @powder @kegs?"|
115|"Which, @torches, @oil, @lockpicks, @gems, @backpacks, @bags, @shovels, or @powder kegs?"|
115|"Why, it's Budo, I believe. That's what it was last week."|

115|He leans forward staring straight into your eyes as he asks "Who sent you?"|
115|He winks at you. "The guild is behind you, as long as you keep our secret."|

116|"After Captain Hawkins passed away, we tore his treasure map into nine pieces."|
116|"All I really want is the magical cloak that's buried with the rest of the treasure."|
116|"Best count again. You need eight pieces before I'll bargain with you."|
116|"Blast ye! If I still had two good legs, I'd keelhaul the lot of you!"|
116|"But remember, only I know where the ninth piece is, so come back here when you've got the other eight."|
116|"Can't help you there."|
116|"Can't say its been a pleasure."|
116|"Can't trust anybody these days..."|
116|"Dig in the patch of dirt just to the south of you, and you'll find the treasure!"|
116|"Don't know anything about it."|
116|"Don't want to keep your word now that you have the map, eh?"|
116|"Farewell, brother thief."|
116|"Fine, '$Z' - if that's what your name really is... You can call me Homer."|
116|"Go ask Budo. And you didn't hear that from me, understand?"|
116|"Good. Then I'll tell you this:"|
116|"Have you found the storm cloak yet?"|
116|"He was killed by his own men, and it was no worse than he deserved."|
116|"He'll be easy to recognize - he has a hook in place o' one of his hands."|
116|"I figure after all these years the others must have given up, so its alright for me to search for the treasure by myself."|
116|"I had to keep it safe while you were off gathering the others, didn't I?"|
116|"I have big plans now, and no time to waste talking."|
116|"I know where my piece of the map is hidden, and if you bring me the other eight pieces, perhaps we could make a deal."|
116|"I know you want the silver tablet. Far as I'm concerned, you can have it."|
116|"I once sailed on the ship called '@Empire,' under Captain @Hawkins."|
116|"I see." He screws his face up into an even more suspicious expression than before.|
116|"I think one of the men died in a shipwreck."|
116|"I'll tell you all I know about where the pieces might be..."|
116|"It was buried in a small @cave."|
116|"It was wrecked on the cape, southwest of here. Not too far from Serpent's Hold."|
116|"Just why do you want to know about it, anyway?"|
116|"Maybe we can help each other out."|
116|"Now go get it!"|
116|"Okay. The ninth piece of the map is hidden..."|
116|"Ol' Hawknose set out for the Dry Land, to kill the daemon that is said to live there."|
116|"Old Ybarra said he was headed for the dungeon Shame, looking for more treasure."|
116|"Right here in my pocket!" He grins wickedly.|
116|"Sandy, the ship's cook, went to Trinsic with the first mate."|
116|"So I'll tell you where the ninth piece of the map is if you promise to bring me the cloak."|
116|"So, have ye found the eight pieces of the map yet?"|
116|"Splitting up the map was my idea - that way nobody could doublecross the others."|
116|"Suit yourself, mate, that's the only deal I'll offer."|
116|"That should put you right next to an old dead tree."|
116|"That's all I know. Perhaps in your travels you can find out where the others have gone."|
116|"The plan was, when nobody was looking for us any more, we'd get together and go dig it up."|
116|"The rest of the treasure should be loot enough to satisfy you. Is it a deal?"|
116|"Then get off your duff and go dig it up!"|
116|"Then hand it over and we're even." His eyes gleam with greedy anticipation.|
116|"Then there was one more... Can't remember his name, but I've heard tell he settled in Jhelom."|
116|"Then walk three paces due south, nine paces due west, and twelve more paces south."|
116|"Then what are you wasting my time for?"|
116|"Trouble is, I've got a bit of the gout in one leg, and I can't travel much any more."|
116|"Very well. I've been thinking about how we could work out a deal."|
116|"We had a deal! Besides, I helped steal that treasure myself, fair and square."|
116|"Well, get on with it!"|
116|"Well, then, I won't tell you where you need to dig to find the treasure!"|
116|"What are you talking about?"|

139|After you're finished, he comes over and puts his arm around your shoulder as he gives you a few pointers on fencing style.|
139|Pulling a couple of sticks from his belt, the gypsy hands you one. You fight with them as if they were swords for a while.|
139|The gypsy leads you into a nearby wagon...|

162|He leans a bit closer. "What was that?"|
162|He looks at you imploringly.|

163|"Hello my good|
163|"I decided banishment was too harsh for him, so I brought him back and made him my jester."\n*\n"The real Chuckles is tied up in my @dungeons. I got tired of him making fun of my nose."|

163|"I told you not to mention that!"|
163|"I was so tough he couldn't chew me, and he had to spit me out. That's when I killed him."|
163|"I'll tell you this, because you look like someone who can keep a secret."\n*\n"I sent out eight fake runes to all the lords, to fool everybody."\n*\n"I put all the real ones in a little box, and hid it under my throne."\n*\n"You can't see it there, because I turned it @invisible!"|

163|Do you give him any money?|

163|He glances around quickly, to see if anyone seems to be listening. "I'm Lord British. But don't tell anyone."\n*\n"I'm in @disguise so I can mingle with the @commoners."|
163|He takes the money. "Good. I'll get this back to you later."|

169|As you turn to leave, the gargoyle stops you.|
169|In a thick accent, the gargoyle croaks, "I bad with human language."|
169|The gargoyle smiles, but his grin is somehow disturbing.|
169|a tall, thin, winged gargoyle.|
170|"Also to teach my young @apprentices not to cut themselves on the glass!"|
170|"But to be called Lor-wis-lem, the scholar of light, by many learned gargoyles."|

170|"To be over a thousand years old."|
170|"To craft the finest lenses in the land," the gargoyle says proudly.|
170|"To have already told you that I need it in order to craft a new one!"|
170|"To have been told by @Naxatilor, long ago, that the you would one day come to me, wearing the Amulet of Submission."|
170|"To have far greater skill now than when first I made this lens," he says smugly.|
170|"To have found him venerable and ancient even then!"|
170|"To have helped Naxatilor create the Vortex Lens, centuries ago."|
170|"To have one last sacred duty:"|
170|"To lack a name, of course."|
170|"To never have believed it would come to pass."|
170|"To pass on my skill to the next generation."|
170|"To remember little from so long ago," the gargoyle croaks.|
170|"To remember making it, so very long ago."|
170|"To require little time to repair it."|
170|"To require the pieces of the lens in order to make a new copy."|
170|"To see the shattered Vortex Lens you carry."|
170|"To seem a mere youth compared to @Naxatilor, however."|
170|"To wonder why you have not brought back the broken lens?!"|
170|As he says this, the ancient gargoyle beams with pride.|
170|He hands you the restored Vortex Lens.|
170|In a short while, he has crafted a new Vortex Lens!|
170|Taking the shards of glass, the lensmaker turns to his grinding table.|
170|The gargoyle gasps in terror and wheezes, "An-bal-sil-fer!"|
170|The gargoyle gasps in terror and wheezes, "The False Prophet!"|
170|The venerable gargoyle peers at you.|
170|Then he faints dead away!|
170|a very old gargoyle.|
171|"But to warn you never to blow the horn!"|
171|"Then to extract the venom so that I can make the @battle-drug."|
171|"To always require many warriors to defeat the creature!"|
171|"To ask what you wish of a simple @snakecharmer?"|
171|"To be but a simple snake charmer, unfamiliar with matters such as that."|
171|"To be called simply by my @job, snakecharmer."|
171|"To be in grave peril from the snake without a squad of warriors!"|
171|"To express my thanks for the sacrifice you have chosen to make!"|
171|"To express sorrow that the drug is fatal, but to express awe and respect for the warriors' sacrifice."|
171|"To feel honored by your visit, False Prophet."|
171|"To find the horn just north of my house."|
171|"To lack a name, of course.|

171|"To--to feel honored to address you, False Prophet."|
171|The gargoyle laughs nervously.|
171|The gargoyle seems afraid of you at first.|
171|The gargoyle shouts, "An-bal-sil-fer!" and flees!|
171|The gargoyle shouts, "The False Prophet!" and flees!|
171|Then he notices the amulet around your neck.|
171|an old winged gargoyle.|
172|"An-bal-sil-fer," the gargoyle says calmly. "Sum in-korp i. Vers."|
172|"But to feel that salvation has come too @late."|
172|"Oh, the False Prophet," the gargoyle says calmly.|
172|"Surely to know what pain you have caused by stealing the Codex?"|
172|"Though to have no reason to make @goods now."|
172|"To ask why you disturb me again, False Prophet."|
172|"To be a goodscrafter."|
172|"To have lost my entire family in the @cataclysms."|

172|"To suppose, then, that my world has been saved."|
172|"To wait here for you to return to kill me."|
172|"To wish not to speak of it."|
172|The gargoyle silently awaits his fate.|
172|a quiet, listless gargoyle.|
173|"An in mani u|
173|"But not to force anyone to act against their will."|
173|"But to be certain that all of you are well!"|
173|"But to be certain that you are well!"|

200|"$0 is one of the guiding principles of the gargoyle race."|
200|"A journey made for selfish reasons can never be a sacred quest, regardless of its goal."|
200|"But how canst thou truly work for the good of a race whose ways thou dost not understand?"|
200|"Continue thy search."|
200|"For whom dost thou truly seek the Codex?"|
200|"Go thou into the @Catacombs of $0, near the coast to the $1 of here."|
200|"Go thou into the @Catacombs of @Control, @Passion and @Diligence."|
200|"Hast thou completed thy journey to the @catacombs?"|
200|"In each wilt thou find the final resting place of the being who most exemplifies that @principle."|
200|"Let the principle of control guide thy quest."|
200|"Let the principle of diligence maintain thy quest."|

201|"'I' and 'you' are words that seem to have no meaning."\n*\n"'I' mimic the way 'you' use them in this language out of courtesy."|
201|"'I' find it unusual that 'you' find it so important to inform 'me' of the imminent cessation of proximity between one unit of Britannian life and one of Xorinite."\n*\n"Nonetheless, in accordance with 'your' custom:\nGoodbye, '$9.'"|
201|"Actual physical materials are so plentiful throughout the multiverse that they are of little value."\n*\n"Information has much greater worth."|
201|"Again, '@you' of this plane address 'I' of the Xorinite dimension."\n*\n"By what name do 'you' wish to be addressed at this time?"|
201|"Because of the nature of Britannian memory, 'I' now present the sample information to 'you' again."\n*\nThe wisp pulsates, fading from blue to white, then back to blue again.\n*\nAs it does so, a scroll materializes in your hand.|
201|"Britannia has never participated in the interplanar exchange of information."\n*\n"'I' have presented a sample known in Britannian terms as a '@secret', but no further interest has been shown."|
201|"Good. Tedious repetition should then be unnecessary on this occasion. Of what would 'you' speak?"|
201|"If 'you' present a reasonably dense information source to a 'wisp' unit, arrangements will be made to transfer some suitably valuable commodity into Britannian possession."|
201|"Once when 'I' offered sample information to Britannia, the name 'Zog' was given by the life unit that received it."\n*\n"No further contact with Britannia was obtainable for some time after this."\n*\n"Perhaps misuse of the sample information was responsible."|
201|"So be it. 'I' must often repeat information when conversing with the life of Britannia, it seems."\n*\n"'I' do not see how each unit of life here can have different memories, different desires, but again 'I' inform Britannia that it is not so in 'my' realm."\n*\n"Those which 'you' know as 'wisp' in Britannia are projections of the life of Xorinia."\n*\n"'I' extend into many planes beside this one."\n*\n"Britannia communicates with 'me' very seldom, and is known by those of very few other planes."\n*\n"Every time 'I' speak with Britannia, it seems 'I' must explain 'my' nature again, as 'I' have just done."\n*\n"That is very strange."|
201|"The concept of 'name' is one 'I' still do not grasp."\n*\n"'I' believe that when 'you' ask 'me' to use '$9' as a form of address, it has something to do with 'name.'"\n*\n"When Britannia addressed me with the name '@Zog,' an attempt was made to explain."*\n"But still 'I' do not understand."|
201|"The vagaries of the language 'you' speak are quite beyond 'me.'"\n*\n"Perhaps another line of inquiry would prove more 'fruitful.'"|
201|"The volume 'you' bear with the symbol pattern representing the sounds 'The Book of Lost Mantras' is a prime source of high density information."\n*\n"Do 'you' wish to 'me' to locate a client who is willing to make an exchange for it at this time?"|
201|"The ways of Britannia are strange indeed."|
201|"Then so be it. Here is useful information from the Rklbwm:"*\n\n'If a substance with a partially reflective surface is positioned so that its third index of refraction matches the wavelength coefficient of the output of a polarized light source, and the resulting beam is focused on an ionized crystal suspended in a unipolar magnetic field, matter can be converted into useful electromagnetic radiation at an efficiency rate of 96 to 98 percent, depending on the desired output frequency.'*\n\n"It was a pleasure doing business with you."|
201|"This is a simple invocation of magic energy to bring about the cessation of all life."\n*\n"It is not a very useful or powerful form of magic, as it will only affect beings in the same plane where it is invoked."\n*\n"Inform any 'wisp' unit if 'you' have @interest in further exchange.|
201|"Very well, '$9.' Do 'you' have memory of previous discussions with 'myself?'"|
201|"Very well."\n*\n"'You' have not sent enough life units to transport much substance, but it is 'your' decision to make."\n*\nThe wisp glows just a trifle brighter for a moment, and suddenly everyone notices that their packs have grown heavier.\n*\n"It was a pleasure doing business with you."|
201|"Xorinia serves as a conduit for @information between different planes."\n*\n"In exchange, these planes provide information that can be used to improve Xorinia."\n*\n"Occasionally payment is accepted in the form of @substance, but this is not preferred."|
201|#|
201|For a few moments, the wisp pulses, saying nothing.\n*\n"It is done," the wisp says at last, "Rklbwm have expressed desire to possess this information."\n*\n"Hoping, no doubt, for a bargain, Rklbwm have offered a small quantity of the substance 'gold' in lieu of the customary useful information."\n*\n"But surely 'you' wish 'me' to arrange for Rklbwm to provide information of value to 'you.'"\n*\n"Am 'I' correct to assume this?"|
201|a strange, glowing ball of energy.\n*|
