INTRO SEQUENCE - Lounge Scene
===========================================

INTRO_LOUNGE_1|Upon your world, five seasons have passed since your triumphant homecoming from Britannia.

INTRO_LOUNGE_2|You have traded the Avatar's life of peril and adventure for the lonely serenity of a world at peace. But television supermen cannot take the place of friends who died at your side!

INTRO_LOUNGE_3|Outside, a chill wind rises...

===========================================
INTRO SEQUENCE - Storm/Window Scene
===========================================

INTRO_WINDOW_1|...and in moments, the storm is upon you.

INTRO_WINDOW_2|Tongues of lightning lash the sky, conducting an unceasing crescendo of thunder....

INTRO_WINDOW_3|In a cataclysm of sound and light, a bolt of searing blue fire strikes the earth!

INTRO_WINDOW_4|Lightning among the stones! Is this a sign from distant Britannia?

INTRO_WINDOW_5|You bolt from your house, stumbling, running blind in the storm. Into the forest, down the path, through the rain... to the stones.

===========================================
INTRO SEQUENCE - Stones Scene
===========================================

INTRO_STONES_1|Near the stones, the smell of damp, blasted earth hangs in the air. In a frozen moment of lightning-struck daylight, you glimpse a tiny obsidian stone in the midst of the circle!

INTRO_STONES_2|Wondering, you pick it up....

INTRO_STONES_3|...and from the heart of the stones, a softly glowing door ascends in silence!

INTRO_STONES_4|Exultant memories wash over you as you clutch the stone. When last you saw an orb such as this, it was cast down by Lord British to banish the tyrant Blackthorn!

INTRO_STONES_5|But your joy soon gives way to apprehension. The gate to Britannia has always been blue... as blue as the morning sky.

INTRO_STONES_6|Abruptly, the portal quivers and begins to sink into the ground. Its crimson light wanes!

INTRO_STONES_7|Desperation makes the decision an easy one.

CHARACTER CREATION - Gypsy Wagon
===========================================

CREATE_GYPSY_1|"Welcome, O Seeker!"

CREATE_GYPSY_2|A lonely stroll along an unfamiliar forest path brings you upon a curious gypsy wagon, its exotic colors dappled in the summer shade.

CREATE_GYPSY_3|A woman's voice rings out with friendship, beckoning you into across the wagon's threshold and, as it happens, into another life....

CREATE_GYPSY_4|"At last thou hast come to fulfill thy destiny," the gypsy says. She smiles, as if in great relief. "Sit before me now, and I shall pour the light of Virtue into the shadows of thy future."

CREATE_GYPSY_5|On a wooden table eight bottles stand, a rainbow of bubbling liquids. "Behold the Virtues of the Avatar," the woman says. "Let us begin the casting!"

CREATE_GYPSY_6|"The path of the Avatar lies beneath thy feet, worthy %NAME%," the gypsy intones. With a mysterious smile, she passes you the flask of shimmering liquids. "Drink of these waters and go forth among our people, who shall receive thee in joy!"

CREATE_GYPSY_7|As you drink from the flask, vertigo overwhelms you. A soothing mist obscures the gypsy's face, and you sink without fear into an untroubled sleep.

CREATE_GYPSY_8|You wake in a different time, upon another world's shore. Though the Avatar's quests bring you both triumph and tragedy, never do you stray from the path of the Eight Virtues.

CREATE_GYPSY_9|The sagas of Ultima IV and Ultima V chronicle your perilous travels, and your name and your deeds are written forever among Britannia's legends....

CREATE_GYPSY_10|Finally, tempered by your struggles against the enemies of Virtue, you are proven ready to answer the epic challenge of Ultima VI!

===========================================
INTRO SEQUENCE - Altar Scene
===========================================

INTRO_ALTAR_1|Dazed, you emerge from the portal to find yourself standing on a desolate plain. Nearby rests a massive rune-struck altar, shrouded in moonlit fog.

INTRO_ALTAR_2|At first the plain is still. Then a hundred voices raise a slow, deathlike song, drawing closer and closer with each passing moment. You are seized by an urge to run...

INTRO_ALTAR_3|...but you have no place to go.

INTRO_ALTAR_4|Before you can offer a protest to the creatures who surround you, scaly claws grasp your body.

INTRO_ALTAR_5|With unearthly strength, the monsters bind you to the altar stone!

INTRO_ALTAR_6|Kneeling, the hordes sway and chant as a stately winged nightmare steps forward.

INTRO_ALTAR_7|The leader unwraps a velvet covered, brass-bound book and recites from it in a formal, stilted tongue.

INTRO_ALTAR_8|Shouts and jeers explode from the masses as the priest slams shut the book. In his hand a malignant dagger drips with moonlight.

INTRO_ALTAR_9|You close your eyes. A dying scream, certainly your own, curdles the air.

INTRO_ALTAR_10|Catcalls, the dagger, a scream, Death....

INTRO_ALTAR_11|Pandemonium. Shrieks of rage, of terror.

INTRO_ALTAR_12|From the inevitable, an impossibility emerges.

INTRO_ALTAR_13|You are still alive.

INTRO_ALTAR_14|Silent red light fills the darkness. There is the wooden clack of a crossbow, and a violet-fletched rose blooms in the priest's barren forehead.

INTRO_ALTAR_15|Friendly faces vault from a newborn moongate, while a rain of quarrels holds the furious mob at bay. The knight Dupre's sword flashes twice in the darkness, slicing away your bonds!

INTRO_ALTAR_16|"Quickly, old friend! To the gate!" Accompanied by the swordsman Shamino and a grinning, crossbow-wielding Iolo the Bard, Dupre thrusts a spare sword into your hand.

INTRO_ALTAR_17|Snatching the fallen priest's book, Iolo dives into the redness with Shamino at his heels. The howling throng surges forward, all of one terrible mind.

INTRO_ALTAR_18|The gate wanes rapidly as you and Dupre charge through...

INTRO_ALTAR_19|...but not rapidly enough.

INTRO_ALTAR_20|From the mob's vanguard, three of the abominations scramble toward the gate. Driven by fury, the creatures hurl their bodies into the portal's last handspan of light!

ENDING SEQUENCE
===========================================

END_1|A glowing portal springs from the floor!

END_2|From its crimson depths Lord British emerges, trailed by the mage Nystul. Anguish and disbelief prevail on the royal seer's face, but Lord British directs his stony gaze at you and speaks as if to a wayward child.

END_3|"Thou didst have just cause to burgle our Codex, I trust?" His Majesty says. "But for Virtue's sake...

END_4|"WHAT HAST THOU DONE WITH IT?"

END_5|You pick up the concave lens and pass it to the King. "Was the book ever truly ours, Your Majesty? Was it written for Britannia alone? Thou dost no longer hold the Codex, but is its wisdom indeed lost? Look into the Vortex, and let the Codex answer for itself!"

END_6|As Lord British holds the glass before the wall, the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom wavers into view against a myriad of swimming stars!

END_7|Yet the book remains closed.

END_8|And waves of heat shimmer in the air, heralding the birth of another red gate!

END_9|King Draxinusom of the Gargoyles strides forward, flanked by a small army of wingless attendants. Like Lord British, he seems to suppress his rage only through a heroic effort of will. His scaly hand grasps your shoulder, and your Amulet of Submission grows very warm.

END_10|"Thy time hath come, Thief," he says.

END_11|Quickly you reach down to seize the convex lens...

END_12|...and you press it into the hand of the towering Gargoyle king, meeting his sunken eyes. "Join my Lord in his search for peace, I beg thee."

END_13|At your urging, King Draxinusom reluctantly raises his lens to catch the light. As Lord British holds up his own lens, every eye in the room, human and Gargoyle alike, fixes upon the image of the Codex which shines upon the wall.

END_14|The ancient book opens. Both kings gaze upon its pages in spellbound silence, as the eloquence of Ultimate Wisdom is revealed in the tongues of each lord's domain. You, too, can read the answers the Codex gives...

END_15|...and when its wisdom is gleaned, when Lord British and King Draxinusom turn to each other as friends, hating no longer, fearing no more, you know that your mission in Britannia has ended at last.
